abstract = "Abstract \{NTAK\} (neural- and thymus-derived activator for ErbB kinases), also known as neuregulin-2 (NRG2), is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, which binds directly to ErbB3 and ErbB4, and transactivates ErbB2. NTAK/NRG2 is structurally homologous to NRG1. The biological function of NTAK/NRG2 still remains unknown, especially in the nervous system, whereas \{NRG1\} is known to be essential for nervous system function. In the present study, we examined the functions of NTAK/NRG2 secreted from astrocytes to neurons. NTAK/NRG2 was expressed in both neurons and astrocytes, as evidenced by immunohistochemical staining and RT-PCR methods. The conditioned medium (CM) from astrocytes promoted survival and neurite outgrowth of neurons. The \{CM\} stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB3 in neurons. When phosphorylation of ErbB3 was blocked by AZD8931, an ErbB3 inhibitor, neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth were reduced. Conversely, canertinib, an ErbB4 inhibitor, did not affect survival or neurite outgrowth of neurons. Survival and neurite outgrowth of neurons were lower in \{CM\} of NTAK/NRG2-knockdown astrocytes than in the \{CM\} of control astrocytes, whereas the \{CM\} of NRG1-knockdown astrocytes had little effect on survival and neurite outgrowth. The present study demonstrated that NTAK/NRG2 secreted from astrocytes bound to ErbB3 on neurons, and promoted neuronal survival and neurite extension in vitro. "

Although mitral/tufted cells are often characterized as the \{OB\} counterpart of cortical projection neurons (also known as pyramidal neurons), they possess several unique morphological characteristics and project specifically to the olfactory cortices. Moreover, the molecular networks contributing to the generation of mitral/tufted cells during development are largely unknown. To understand the developmental patterns of gene expression in mitral/tufted cells in the OB, we performed transcriptome analyses targeting purified \{OB\} projection neurons at different developmental time points with next-generation \{RNA\} sequencing (RNA-seq). Through these analyses, we found 1202 protein-coding genes that are temporally differentially-regulated in developing projection neurons. Among them, 388 genes temporally changed their expression level only in projection neurons. The data provide useful resource to study the molecular mechanisms regulating development of mitral/tufted cells. We further compared the gene expression profiles of developing mitral/tufted cells with those of three cortical projection neuron subtypes, subcerebral projection neurons, corticothalamic projection neurons, and callosal projection neurons, and found that the molecular signature of developing olfactory projection neuron bears resemblance to that of subcerebral neurons. We also identified 3422 events that change the ratio of splicing isoforms in mitral/tufted cells during maturation. Interestingly, several genes expressed a novel isoform not previously reported. These results provide us with a broad perspective of the molecular networks underlying the development of \{OB\} projection neurons. "

Orexin neurons may be involved in these functions as they promote thermogenesis, food intake and behavioral arousal, and are sensitive to temperature and metabolic status. How thermal and energy balance signals are integrated in these neurons is unknown. Thus, we investigated the cellular mechanisms of thermosensing in orexin neurons and their response to a change in energy status using whole-cell patch clamp on rat brain slices. We found that warming induced an increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) frequency, which was blocked by the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor antagonist \{AMG9810\} and mimicked by its agonist capsaicin, suggesting that the synaptic effect is mediated by heat-sensitive \{TRPV1\} channels. Furthermore, warming inhibits orexin neurons by activating ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, an effect regulated by uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), as the \{UCP2\} inhibitor genipin abolished this response. These properties are unique to orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, as neighboring melanin-concentrating hormone neurons showed no response to warming within the physiological temperature range. Interestingly, in rats fed with western diet for 1 or 11 weeks, orexin neurons had impaired synaptic and \{KATP\} response to warming. In summary, this study reveals several mechanisms underlying thermosensing in orexin neurons and their attenuation by western diet. Overeating induced by western diet may in part be due to impaired orexin thermosensing, as post-prandial thermogenesis may promote satiety and lethargy by inhibiting orexin neurons. "

In specific, we used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to assess growth/trophic factor protein expression in spinal sections from rats exposed to \{AIH\} three times per week for 10 weeks (3 × wAIH). 3 × wAIH increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), and phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB) immunoreactivity in putative alpha motor neurons of spinal cervical 7 (C7) and lumbar 3 (L3) segments, as well as in upper motor neurons of the primary motor cortex (M1). 3 × wAIH also increased immunoreactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), the high-affinity \{VEGFA\} receptor (VEGFR-2) and an important \{VEGF\} gene regulator, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Thus, rAIH effects on growth/trophic factors are characteristic of non-respiratory as well as respiratory motor neurons. rAIH may be a useful tool in the treatment of disorders causing paralysis, such as spinal injury and motor neuron disease, as a pretreatment to enhance motor neuron survival during disease, or as preconditioning for cell-transplant therapies.

Such neurons may play a role in shaping integrated adaptive responses, and many of them were found within well-characterized regions of noradrenergic cell populations suggesting that some of the \{PSPMNs\} are catecholaminergic. To address this issue, we used retrograde trans-synaptic tract-tracing with attenuated pseudorabies virus (PRV) recombinants combined with multi-label immunofluorescence to identify \{PSPMNs\} expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Our findings indicate that TH-immunoreactive (ir) \{PSPMNs\} are present throughout the brainstem within multiple cell populations, including the A1, C1, C2, C3, \{A5\} and \{A7\} cell groups along with the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus subcoeruleus (SubC). The largest numbers of TH-ir \{PSPMNs\} were located within the \{LC\} and SubC. Within SubC and the \{A7\} cell group, about 70% of TH-ir neurons were PSPMNs, which was a significantly greater fraction of neurons than in the other brain regions we examined. These findings indicate that TH-ir neurons near the pontomesencephalic junction that are distributed across the LC, SubC, and the \{A7\} may play a prominent role in somatomotor–sympathetic integration, and that the major functional role of the \{A7\} and SubC noradrenergic cell groups maybe in the coordination of concomitant activation of somatomotor and sympathetic outflows. These neurons may participate in mediating homeostatic adaptations that require simultaneous activation of sympathetic and somatomotor nerves in the periphery. "

While the thrombolytic effects of tPA have been well established, the impact of this blood–brain barrier (BBB) crossing drug on neurons is not known. Given the widespread use of tPA in the clinical setting and the strict therapeutic window established for effective use of the drug, we examined the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of tPA on postnatal cortical neurons isolated from the mouse brain. Dissociated postnatal primary cortical neurons were treated with tPA and the effects on neuron survival were evaluated. Pharmacological inhibitors of several signaling pathways previously implicated in neuroprotection (mTOR, JAK/STAT, \{MAPK\} and PKA-dependent mechanisms) were used to pinpoint the mechanistic effectors of tPA on neuron survival in vitro. We report here that tPA treatment results in a time-dependent neuroprotective effect on postnatal cortical neurons that relies predominantly on Janus kinase (JAK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling mechanisms. Taken together, these data suggest that tPA promotes neuroprotection in a temporally-regulated manner and that both \{JAK\} and mTOR signaling effectors are critical mediators of this neuroprotective effect. The results suggest the possibility of targeting these defined mechanisms to potentially expand the therapeutic window for tPA. "

Three-day-old larvae were exposed to micromolar concentrations of MeHg (0.03, 0.06, and 0.3 μM) in system water. Exposure to 0.3 μM MeHg caused mortality and significant morphological abnormalities including edema, curvature of the spine, and hemorrhages in zebrafish larvae after a 48 h exposure period. At 0.06 μM MeHg, the appearance of morphological abnormalities was delayed for 72 h and far less severe, whereas 0.03 μM MeHg did not cause any morphological defects or mortalities. A delayed but significant reduction in locomotor ability and mCherry fluorescence in specific brain regions in the 0.06 μM MeHg exposed larvae suggests that \{DA\} neuron function rather than neuron numbers was compromised. Double immunolabeling with tyrosine hydroxylase and pan neural staining showed no effect of MeHg exposure. We have established Tg(dat:tom20 MLS-mCherry) zebrafish larvae as a model which can be used to assess MeHg neurotoxicity and that exposure to low dose MeHg (0.06 μM) during development may predispose \{DA\} neurons to impairment caused by changes in mitochondrial dynamics.

Here, we show that there is a significant reduction in both spinal cord motor neurons and motor function over time in the aging rat. One explanation for this motor neuron loss could be reduced support from surrounding aging astrocytes. Indeed, we have previously shown using in vitro models that aging rat astrocytes are less supportive to rat motor neuron function and survival over time. Here, we test whether rejuvenating the astrocyte niche can improve the survival of motor neurons in an aging spinal cord. We transplanted fetal-derived human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) into the aging rat spinal cord and found that the cells survive and differentiate into astrocytes with a much higher efficiency than when transplanted into younger animals, suggesting that the aging environment stimulates astrocyte maturation. Importantly, the engrafted astrocytes were able to protect against motor neuron loss associated with aging, although this did not result in an increase in motor function based on behavioral assays. We also transplanted hNPCs genetically modified to secrete glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) into the aging rat spinal cord, as this combination of cell and protein delivery can protect motor neurons in animal models of ALS. During aging, GDNF-expressing hNPCs protected motor neurons, though to the same extent as hNPCs alone, and again had no effect on motor function. We conclude that hNPCs can survive well in the aging spinal cord, protect motor neurons and mature faster into astrocytes when compared to transplantation into the young spinal cord. While there was no functional improvement, there were no functional deficits either, further supporting a good safety profile of hNPC transplantation even into the older patient population. "

To generate these motor signals, \{DCN\} neurons integrate synaptic inputs with their own spontaneous activity. We have previously reported that N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels modulate the spontaneous activity of the majority of juvenile \{DCN\} neurons in vitro. Specifically, pharmacologically blocking N-type Ca2+ channels increases their firing rate causing \{DCN\} cells to burst. Adult \{DCN\} neurons however, behaved differently. To further investigate this change, we have studied here the effect of cadmium on the firing rate of \{DCN\} neurons in acute cerebellar slices obtained from adult (&gt;2 months old) or juvenile (12–21 days old) rats and mice. Strikingly, and in contrast to juvenile \{DCN\} cells, cadmium did not affect the pacemaking of adult \{DCN\} cells. The activity of Purkinje cells (PCs) however was transformed into high-frequency bursting, regardless the age. Further, we questioned whether these findings could be due to an artifact associated with the added difficulty of preparing adult \{DCN\} slices. Hence we proceeded to examine the spontaneous activity of \{DCN\} neurons in anesthetized juvenile and adult rats and mice in vivo. When cadmium was injected into the \{DCN\} in vivo no significant change in firing rate was observed, conversely to most juvenile \{DCN\} neurons which showed high-frequency bursts after cadmium injection. In these same animals, \{PCs\} pacemaking showed no developmental difference. Thus our results demonstrate a remarkable age-dependent functional modification in the regulation of \{DCN\} neurons pacemaking. "

We and others, however, have shown that hippocampus-derived estradiol also controls synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Estradiol synthesis in the hippocampus is regulated by several mechanisms, which are reviewed in this report. The regulation of the activity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estrogen biosynthesis, by Ca2+ transients, is of particular interest. Aromatase becomes inactivated as soon as it is phosphorylated by Ca2+-dependent kinases upon calcium release from internal stores. Accordingly, thapsigargin dephosphorylates aromatase and stimulates estradiol synthesis by depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. Vice versa, letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, phosphorylates aromatase and reduces estradiol synthesis. Treatment of the cultures with 17β-estradiol results in phosphorylation of the enzyme and increased aromatase protein expression, which suggests that estradiol synthesis in hippocampal neurons is regulated in an autocrine manner.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons associated to an inflammatory process that usually aggravates the disease progression. In \{ALS\} animal models, the activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 in astrocytes confers protection to neighboring neurons. It is currently unknown whether NO2-FA can exert protective activity in \{ALS\} through Nrf2 activation. Herein we demonstrate that nitro-arachidonic acid (NO2-AA) or nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA) administrated to astrocytes expressing the ALS-linked hSOD1G93A induce antioxidant phase \{II\} enzyme expression through Nrf2 activation concomitant with increasing intracellular glutathione levels. Furthermore, treatment of hSOD1G93A-expressing astrocytes with NO2-FA prevented their toxicity to motor neurons. Transfection of siRNA targeted to Nrf2 mRNA supported the involvement of Nrf2 activation in NO2-FA-mediated protective effects. Our results show for the first time that NO2-FA induce a potent Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response in astrocytes capable of preventing motor neurons death in a culture model of ALS. "

abstract = "Abstract Diamond is a promising material for a number of bio-applications, including the fabrication of platforms for attachment and investigation of neurons and of neuroprostheses, such as retinal implants. In the current work ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) films were deposited by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition, modified by UV/O3 treatment or \{NH3\} plasma, and comprehensively characterized with respect to their bulk and surface properties, such as crystallinity, topography, composition and chemical bonding nature. The interactions of insect circadian pacemaker neurons with \{UNCD\} surfaces with H–, O– and NH2-terminations were investigated with respect to cell density and viability. The fast and strong attachment achieved without application of adhesion proteins allowed for advantageous modification of dispersion protocols for the preparation of primary cell cultures. Centrifugation steps, which are employed for pelletizing dispersed cells to separate them from dispersing enzymes, easily damage neurons. Now centrifugation can be avoided since dispersed neurons quickly and strongly attach to the \{UNCD\} surfaces. Enzyme solutions can be easily washed off without losing many of the dispersed cells. No adverse effects on the cell viability and physiological responses were observed as revealed by calcium imaging. Furthermore, the enhanced attachment of the neurons, especially on the modified \{UNCD\} surfaces, was especially advantageous for the immunocytochemical procedures with the cell cultures. The cell losses during washing steps were significantly reduced by one order of magnitude in comparison to controls. In addition, the integration of a titanium grid structure under the \{UNCD\} films allowed for individual assignment of physiologically characterized neurons to immunocytochemically stained cells. Thus, employing \{UNCD\} surfaces free of foreign proteins improves cell culture protocols and immunocytochemistry with cultured cells. The fast and strong attachment of neurons was attributed to a favorable combination of topography, surface chemistry and wettability. "

The results of GA-ANN were compared with those got by the Genetic Programming (GP) method as two applications of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The comparisons showed that the GA-ANN model can predict the open channel junction velocity with higher accuracy than the \{GP\} model, with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.086 and 0.156, respectively. Finally the equation, obtained by applying the GA-ANN model, predicting the velocity at the open channel junction is presented. "

However the neuronal correlates of core components of this model have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we present data from two studies where human temporal cortical single neuron activity was recorded during tasks differentially affecting the maintenance component of verbal working memory. In Study One we vary the presence or absence of distracting items for the entire period of memory storage. In Study Two we vary the duration of storage so that distractors filled all, or only one-third of the time the memory was stored. Extracellular single neuron recordings were obtained from 36 subjects undergoing awake temporal lobe resections for epilepsy, 25 in Study one, 11 in Study two. Recordings were obtained from a total of 166 lateral temporal cortex neurons during performance of one of these two tasks, 86 study one, 80 study two. Significant changes in activity with distractor manipulation were present in 74 of these neurons (45%), 38 Study one, 36 Study two. In 48 (65%) of those there was increased activity during the period when distracting items were absent, 26 Study One, 22 Study Two. The magnitude of this increase was greater for Study One, 47.6%, than Study Two, 8.1%, paralleling the reduction in memory errors in the absence of distracters, for Study One of 70.3%, Study Two 26.3% These findings establish that human lateral temporal cortex is part of the neural system for working memory, with activity during maintenance of that memory that parallels performance, suggesting it represents active rehearsal. In 31 of these neurons (65%) this activity was an extension of that during working memory encoding that differed significantly from the neural processes recorded during overt and silent language tasks without a recent memory component, 17 Study one, 14 Study two. Contrary to the Baddeley model, that activity during verbal working memory maintenance often represented activity specific to working memory rather than speech or language. "

This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of carnosine on neuron/astrocyte co-cultures exposed to OGD/recovery, and to explore whether the \{ANLS\} or any other mechanism contributes to carnosine-induced neuroprotection on neuron/astrocyte. Co-cultures were treated with carnosine and exposed to OGD/recovery. Cell death and the extracellular levels of glutamate and \{GABA\} were measured. The mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were detected by Seahorse Bioscience \{XF96\} Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Results showed that carnosine decreased neuronal cell death, increased extracellular \{GABA\} level, and abolished the increase in extracellular glutamate and reversed the mitochondrial energy metabolism disorder induced by OGD/recovery. Carnosine also upregulated the mRNA level of neuronal glutamate transporter \{EAAC1\} at 2 h after OGD. Dihydrokainate, a specific inhibitor of GLT-1, decreased glycolysis but it did not affect mitochondrial respiration of the cells, and it could not reverse the increase in mitochondrial \{OXPHOS\} induced by carnosine in the co-cultures. The levels of mRNAs for monocarboxylate transporter1, 4 (MCT1, 4), which were expressed in astrocytes, and MCT2, the main neuronal MCT, were significantly increased at the early stage of recovery. Carnosine only partly reversed the increased expression of astrocytic \{MCT1\} and MCT4. These results suggest that regulating astrocytic energy metabolism and extracellular glutamate and \{GABA\} levels but not the \{ANLS\} are involved in the carnosine-induced neuroprotection. "

To determine whether \{AIs\} produce hypersensitivity in animal models of pain, we examined the effects of the AI, letrozole, on mechanical, thermal, and chemical sensitivity in rats. In ovariectomized (OVX) rats, administering a single dose of 1 or 5 mg/kg letrozole significantly reduced mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds, without altering thermal sensitivity. Repeated injection of 5 mg/kg letrozole in male rats produced mechanical, but not thermal, hypersensitivity that extinguished when drug dosing was stopped. A single dose of 5 mg/kg letrozole or daily dosing of letrozole or exemestane in male rats also augmented flinching behavior induced by intraplantar injection of 1000 nmol of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). To determine whether sensitization of sensory neurons contributed to AI-induced hypersensitivity, we evaluated the excitability of neurons isolated from dorsal root ganglia of male rats chronically treated with letrozole. Both small and medium-diameter sensory neurons isolated from letrozole-treated rats were more excitable, as reflected by increased action potential firing in response to a ramp of depolarizing current, a lower resting membrane potential, and a lower rheobase. However, systemic letrozole treatment did not augment the stimulus-evoked release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from spinal cord slices, suggesting that the enhanced nociceptive responses were not secondary to an increase in peptide release from sensory endings in the spinal cord. These results provide the first evidence that \{AIs\} modulate the excitability of sensory neurons, which may be a primary mechanism for the effect of these drugs to augment pain behaviors in rats. "

Compounds that can increase progranulin production and secretion may be considered as potential therapeutic drugs; however, very few of them have been directly tested on human cortical neurons. To this end, we differentiated 9 induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from a control subject, a sporadic \{FTD\} case and an \{FTD\} patient with progranulin \{S116X\} mutation. Treatment with 1 μM suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, increased the production of progranulin in cortical neurons of all subjects at both the mRNA and protein levels without affecting their viability. Microarray analysis revealed that \{SAHA\} treatment not only reversed some gene expression changes caused by progranulin haploinsufficiency but also caused massive alterations in the overall transcriptome. Thus, histone deacetylase inhibitors may be considered as therapeutic drugs for \{GRN\} mutation carriers. However, this class of drugs also causes drastic changes in overall gene expression in human cortical neurons and their side effects and potential impacts on other pathways should be carefully evaluated.

As a function of intrinsic control parameters α, σ, η, reversal potential v, synaptic parameters θ, k, and external chemical coupling strength gc, conditions for stability of a fixed point for this system are derived. Some typical domains are chosen for numerical simulations which include time evolution of transmembrane voltages and phase portraits, and both of them are presented for theoretical analysis. Based on the master stability functions approach and calculation of the maximum Lyapunov exponents of synchronization errors, synchronized regions of the coupled neurons and a strip-shaped chaotic structure in parameter-space are obtained. Specially, given some values of control parameter α, we propose interval ranges of coupling strength gc in which the two chaotic Rulkov map-based neurons can be synchronized completely. It is shown that there exist different transition mechanisms of the neuronal spiking and bursting synchronization. The synchronized regions will become smaller and smaller as control parameter α or synaptic parameter θ increases. Nevertheless, the coupled neurons can at first transit from desynchrony to in-phase synchronization, and then to complete synchronization as chemical coupling strength gc increases. Compared with control parameter α and synaptic parameter θ, chemical coupling strength gc plays an opposite role in the process of synchronization transition. These findings could be useful for further understanding the role of two chaotic Rulkov maps coupled by bidirectional and symmetric chemical synapses in the field of cooperative behaviors of coupled neurons.

However, manual processing of these images has become infeasible. Thus, there is a need to create automatic methods for the morphological reconstruction of 3D neuronal image stacks. New method An algorithm to extract the 3D morphology from a neuron is presented. The main contribution of the paper is the segmentation of the neuron from the background. Our segmentation method is based on one-class classification where the 3D image stack is analyzed at different scales. First, a multi-scale approach is proposed to compute the Laplacian of the 3D image stack. The Laplacian is used to select a training set consisting of background points. A decision function is learned for each scale from the training set that allows determining how similar an unlabeled point is to the points in the background class. Foreground points (dendrites and axons) are assigned as those points that are rejected as background. Finally, the morphological reconstruction of the neuron is extracted by applying a state-of-the-art centerline tracing algorithm on the segmentation. Results Quantitative and qualitative results on several datasets demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to accurately and robustly segment and trace neurons. Comparison with existing method(s) Our method was compared to state-of-the-art neuron tracing algorithms. Conclusions Our approach allows segmentation of thin and low contrast dendrites that are usually difficult to segment. Compared to our previous approach, this algorithm is more accurate and much faster. "

In the literature, although there is a robust learning algorithm for the former, there is no such algorithm for the latter. Because of its multiplicative structure, the performance of multiplicative neuron model \{ANNs\} is affected negatively when the dataset has outliers. On this issue, a robust learning algorithm for the multiplicative neuron model \{ANNs\} is proposed that uses Huber's loss function as fitness function. The training of the multiplicative neuron model is performed using particle swarm optimization. One principle advantage of this algorithm is that the parameter of the scale estimator, which is an important factor affecting the value of Huber's loss function, is also estimated with the proposed algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, it is applied to two well-known real world time series datasets, and also a simulation study is performed. The algorithm has superior performance both when it is applied to real world time series datasets and the simulation study when compared with other \{ANNs\} reported in the literature. Another of its advantages is that, for datasets with outliers, the results are very close to the results obtained from the original datasets. In other words, we demonstrate that the algorithm is unaffected by outliers and has a robust structure. "

New method Here we describe a detail method for robust generation of \{BFCNs\} from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In this method, \{BFCN\} progenitors are patterned from hESC or hiPSC-derived primitive neuroepithelial cells, with the treatment of sonic hedgehog (SHH) or combination with its agonist Purmorphamine, and by co-culturing with human astrocytes. Results At day 20, ∼90% hPSC-derived progenitors expressed NKX2.1, which is a transcriptional marker for MGE. Moreover, around 40% of NKX2.1+ cells co-expressed \{OLIG2\} and ∼15% of NKX2.1+ cells co-expressed ISLET1, which are ventral markers. At day 35, ∼40% neurons robustly express ChAT, most of which are co-labeled with NKX2.1, \{ISLET1\} and FOXG1, indicating the basal forebrain-like identity. At day 45, these neurons express mature neuronal markers MAP2, Synapsin, and VAChT. Comparison with existing method(s) In this method, undefined conditions including genetic modification or cell-sorting are avoided. As a choice, feeder free conditions are used to avoid ingredients of animal origin. Moreover, Purmorphamine can be substituted for \{SHH\} to induce ventral progenitors effectively and economically. Conclusion We provide an efficient method to generate \{BFCNs\} from multiple hPSC lines, which offers the potential application for disease modeling and pharmacological studies. "

Sympathetic activity was measured by renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). Stereology of thoracic (T13) ganglia was performed to determine neuronal loss. Despite loss of more than two thirds of neurons in \{T13\} ganglia in both treated groups no effect on resting blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) was detected. Basal \{RSNA\} in rats treated for 5 days (0.61 ± 0.10 μV ∗ s) and 11 days (0.37 ± 0.08 μV ∗ s) was significantly less than vehicle-treated rats (0.99 ± 0.13 μV ∗ s, p &lt; 0.05).

abstract = "Abstract The spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are the first action potential generating neurons in the auditory pathway. The type I \{SGNs\} contact the sensory inner hair cells via their peripheral dendrites and relay auditory information to the brainstem via their central axon fibers. Individual afferent fibers show differences in response properties that are essential for normal hearing. The mechanisms that give rise to the heterogeneity of afferent responses are very poorly understood but are likely already in place at the peripheral dendrites where synapses are formed and action potentials are generated. To identify these molecular mechanisms, this review synthesizes a variety of literature and comprehensively outlines the cellular and molecular components positioned to regulate \{SGN\} afferent dendrite excitability, especially following glutamate release. These components include 1) proteins of the \{SGN\} postsynapses and neighboring supporting cells that together shape glutamatergic signaling, 2) the ion channels and transporters that determine the intrinsic excitability of the \{SGN\} afferent dendrites, and 3) the neurotransmitter receptors that extrinsically modify this excitability via synaptic input from the lateral olivocochlear efferents. This cellular and molecular machinery, together with presynaptic specializations of the inner hair cells, can be collectively referred to as the type I afferent signaling complex. As this review underscores, interactions of this signaling complex determine excitability of the \{SGN\} afferent dendrites and the afferent fiber responses. Moreover, this complex establishes the environmental milieu critical for the development and maintenance of the \{SGN\} afferent dendrites and synapses. Motivated by these important functions, this review also indicates areas of future research to elucidate the contributions of the afferent signaling complex to both normal hearing and also hearing loss.

abstract = "Abstract We investigate the effect of network architecture on burst and spike synchronization in a directed scale-free network (SFN) of bursting neurons, evolved via two independent α - and β -processes. The α -process corresponds to a directed version of the Barabási–Albert \{SFN\} model with growth and preferential attachment, while for the β -process only preferential attachments between pre-existing nodes are made without addition of new nodes. We first consider the “pure” α -process of symmetric preferential attachment (with the same in- and out-degrees), and study emergence of burst and spike synchronization by varying the coupling strength J and the noise intensity D for a fixed attachment degree. Characterizations of burst and spike synchronization are also made by employing realistic order parameters and statistical-mechanical measures. Next, we choose appropriate values of J and D where only burst synchronization occurs, and investigate the effect of the scale-free connectivity on the burst synchronization by varying (1) the symmetric attachment degree and (2) the asymmetry parameter (representing deviation from the symmetric case) in the α -process, and (3) the occurrence probability of the β -process. In all these three cases, changes in the type and the degree of population synchronization are studied in connection with the network topology such as the degree distribution, the average path length L p , and the betweenness centralization B c . It is thus found that just taking into consideration L p and B c (affecting global communication between nodes) is not sufficient to understand emergence of population synchronization in SFNs, but in addition to them, the in-degree distribution (affecting individual dynamics) must also be considered to fully understand for the effective population synchronization.

To bypass these limitations, we developed an approach by combining conventional 3D printing and freeze-drying techniques to produce lattice-type backbone and embedding microporous structures. Polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), a biocompatible and photosensitive pre-polymer, was chosen for 3D printing of the backbone, while gelatin was used for the formation of microporous structures. The fabricated PEGDA/gelatin scaffolds were used for culture and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), showing infiltration of the cells and outgrowth of differentiated neurites. This strategy of combined use of 3D printing and freeze-drying techniques might be useful for scaffold fabrication in terms of easy design and easy material processing. "

This intrinsic system is proposed to be composed of a short cardio-cardiac feedback control loop within the cardiac innervation hierarchy. For example, electrophysiological studies have postulated the presence of sensory neurons in intrinsic cardiac ganglia for regional cardiac control. There is still a knowledge gap, however, about the anatomical location and neurochemical phenotype of sensory neurons inside intrinsic cardiac ganglia. In the present study, rat intrinsic cardiac ganglia neurons were characterized neurochemically with immunohistochemistry using glutamatergic markers: vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1; VGLUT2), and glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme essential for glutamate production. Glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT1/VGLUT2/GLS) in the \{ICG\} that have axons to the ventricles were identified by retrograde tracing of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injected in the ventricular wall. Co-labeling of VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and \{GLS\} with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was used to evaluate the relationship between post-ganglionic autonomic neurons and glutamatergic neurons. Sequential labeling of \{VGLUT1\} and \{VGLUT2\} in adjacent tissue sections was used to evaluate the co-localization of \{VGLUT1\} and \{VGLUT2\} in \{ICG\} neurons. Our studies yielded the following results: (1) intrinsic cardiac ganglia contain glutamatergic neurons with \{GLS\} for glutamate production and \{VGLUT1\} and 2 for transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles; (2) atrial intrinsic cardiac ganglia contain neurons that project to ventricle walls and these neurons are glutamatergic; (3) many glutamatergic \{ICG\} neurons also were cholinergic, expressing VAChT. (4) \{VGLUT1\} and \{VGLUT2\} co-localization occurred in \{ICG\} neurons with variation of their protein expression level. Investigation of both glutamatergic and cholinergic \{ICG\} neurons could help in better understanding the function of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system. "

abstract = "Abstract Over the last thirty years, a growing number of studies showed that astrocytes play a pivotal role in the energy support to synapses. More precisely, astrocytes adjust energy production to neuronal energy needs through different mechanisms grouped under the term “neurometabolic coupling” (NMC). In this review we describe these mechanisms of coupling and how they involve astrocytes. From a physiological point of view, these mechanisms of coupling are particularly important to ensure normal synaptic functioning when neurons undergo rapid and repetitive changes in the firing rate such as during the sleep/wake transitions. Investigations into brain energy metabolism during the sleep/wake cycle have been mainly focused on glucose (Gluc) consumption and on glycogen metabolism. However, the recent development of substrate-specific biosensors allowed measurements of the variation in extracellular levels of glutamate, Gluc and lactate (Lac) with a time resolution compatible with sleep stage duration. Together with gene expression data these experiments allowed to better define the variations of energy metabolite regulation across the sleep/wake cycle. The aim of this review is to bring into perspective the role of astrocytes and \{NMC\} in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. The data reviewed also suggest an important role of the astrocytic network. In addition, the role of astrocytes in \{NMC\} mechanisms is consistent with the “local and use dependent” sleep hypothesis. "

With ethical approval, 10 consenting right-handed patients with schizophrenia (ICD-10-DCR; M = 8; Drug-naïve = 2) were recruited and divided into two groups of five each (M = 4, F = 1): those with (age 29.40 ± 5.85 years, duration of illness 50.80 ± 30.84 months) and without (age 29.60 ± 5.77 years, duration of illness 43.20 ± 43.76 months) family history of schizophrenic illness (group difference p &gt; 0.05). \{MNS\} activity was assessed using event-related desynchronization of \{EEG\} Mu waves in response to biological motion on 192-channel \{EEG\} Neurofax EEG-1100K. On comparison, while patients had significantly lower mu suppression compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001); two schizophrenia groups did not differ between themselves, neither on \{MNS\} activity nor on psychopathology (p &gt; 0.05). Present study replicates finding of a dysfunctional \{MNS\} in schizophrenia patients, and represents a preliminary attempt at comparing two groups of symptomatic schizophrenia patients. In both these groups, \{MNS\} dysfunctions were comparable, and commensurate with respect to psychopathology. Thus, \{MNS\} dysfunction in schizophrenia might either be inherited or acquired. However, this abnormality forms a common base, and ultimate vulnerability marker, for development of psychopathology during active disease states. "

Proper functioning of the striatum relies on the fine dynamic balance between the direct pathway projection medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that express \{D1\} dopamine receptor (D1 MSNs) and indirect pathway projection \{MSNs\} that express \{D2\} dopamine receptor (D2 MSNs). The inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Kir), which express on both \{D1\} and \{D2\} MSNs, participate in the subthreshold dynamics including the membrane resonance and dendritic integration. However, it remains unclear whether dopamine differentially regulates Kir mediated subthreshold dynamics in two subtypes MSNs. Using transgenic mice that express either tdTomato in \{D1\} \{MSNs\} or eGFP in \{D2\} MSNs, we explored the Kir mediated subthreshold dynamics in \{D1\} or \{D2\} \{MSNs\} with whole cell patch clamp recording in acute brain slices. We found that \{D1\} receptor agonist increased the Kir current while \{D2\} receptor activation decreased the Kir conductance. The dopamine regulation of the Kir enhanced the resonant frequency and reduced the resonant impedance of \{D1\} MSNs. The converse is ture for \{D2\} MSNs. It also caused an opposing effect on dendritic integration between \{D1\} and \{D2\} MSNs, which can promote stability of the two pathways. The \{D1\} receptor activation modulated Kir through cAMP-PKA signaling, whereas the \{D2\} receptor modulated Kir through PLC-PKC signaling. Our findings demonstrated the differential dopaminergic regulation role of Kir, which mediates distinct subthreshold dynamics, and thus, contributes to the role of dopamine in fine tuning the balance of the striatal direct and indirect pathway activities.

Preclinical studies using the \{L5\} spinal nerve ligation/axotomy (SNL/SNA) model of \{PNP\} suggest that this type of chronic pain results partly from sensitization of ipsilateral L4C-and Aδ-fiber nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, but whether \{L4\} #XPS#beta;-nociceptors, which constitute a substantial group of \{DRG\} neurons, also become sensitized remains unanswered. To address this issue, intracellular recordings from somata of cutaneous Aβ-nociceptors (classified according to their dorsal root conduction velocities ( &gt; 6.5m/s), and physiologically based on their responses to noxious (but not innocuous) mechanical stimuli) were made from L4-DRGs in normal (control) rats and in rats seven days after \{L5\} \{SNA\} in vivo. Compared with control, cutaneous \{L4\} Aβ-nociceptive \{DRG\} neurons in \{SNA\} rats (that developed mechanical hypersensitivity) exhibited sensitization indicated by: a) decreased mean mechanical threshold (from 57.8 ± 7.1 to 10.3 ± 1.7 mN), b) decreased mean dorsal root electrical threshold (from 11.4 ±0.7 to 4.3 ±0.4 Volts), c) increased mean response to a suprathreshold mechanical stimulus (from 18.5 ±1.8 to 34 ± 3.7 spikes/sec) and d) an obvious, but non-significant, increase in the incidence of ongoing/spontaneous activity (from 3% to 18%). These findings suggest that cutaneous \{L4\} Aβ-nociceptors also become sensitized after \{L5\} SNA, and that sensitization of this subclass of A-fiber nociceptors may contribute both directly and indirectly to nerve injury-induced PNP.

We examined whether the morphology and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in soma of RAGP, VIVGP, \{DRG\} and \{SG\} neurons were altered as a consequence of chronic MI. In DRG, we also examined immunoreactivity of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), a marker of afferent neurons. Chronic \{MI\} increased neuronal size and nNOS immunoreactivity in \{VIVGP\} (but not RAGP), as well as in the \{SG\} bilaterally. Across these ganglia, the increase in neuronal size was more pronounced in nNOS immunoreactive neurons. In the DRG, chronic \{MI\} also caused neuronal enlargement, and increased \{CGRP\} immunoreactivity. Further, \{DRG\} neurons expressing both nNOS and \{CGRP\} were increased in \{MI\} animals compared to controls, and represented a shift from double negative neurons. Conclusions Chronic \{MI\} impacts diverse elements within the peripheral cardiac neuraxis. That chronic \{MI\} imposes such widespread, diverse remodeling of the peripheral cardiac neuraxis must be taken into consideration when contemplating neuronal regulation of the ischemic heart. "

In this study, we identified a novel functional role of the 5-HT1D receptor subtype in regulating A-type potassium (K+) currents (IA) as well as membrane excitability in small trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. We found that the selective activation of 5-HT1D, rather than 5-HT1B, receptors reversibly increased IA, while the sustained delayed rectifier K+ current was unaffected. The 5-HT1D-mediated \{IA\} increase was associated with a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation. Blocking G-protein signaling with pertussis toxin or by intracellular application of a selective antibody raised against Gαo or Gβ abolished the 5-HT1D effect on IA. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA), but not of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or protein kinase C, abolished the 5-HT1D–mediated \{IA\} increase. Analysis of phospho-p38 (p-p38) revealed that activation of 5-HT1D, but not 5-HT1B, receptors significantly activated p38, while p-ERK and p-JNK were unaffected. The p38 \{MAPK\} inhibitor SB203580, but not its inactive analogue SB202474, and inhibition of B-Raf blocked the 5-HT1D-mediated \{IA\} response. Functionally, we observed a significantly decreased action potential firing rate induced by the 5-HT1D receptors; pretreatment with 4-aminopyridine abolished this effect. Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of 5-HT1D receptors selectively enhanced \{IA\} via the Gβγ of the Go-protein, PKA, and the sequential B-Raf-dependent p38 \{MAPK\} signaling cascade. This 5-HT1D receptor effect may contribute to neuronal hypoexcitability in small \{TG\} neurons. "

Locomotor disturbances have also been described in contaminated animals. Epidemiological studies have revealed increased risk of motor neuron diseases in veterans potentially exposed to uranium during their military duties. To our knowledge, biological response of spinal cord to uranium contamination has not been studied even though it has a crucial role in locomotion. Four groups of rats were contaminated with increasing concentrations of uranium in their drinking water compared to a control group to study cellular mechanisms involved in locomotor disorders. Nissl staining of spinal cord sections revealed the presence of chromatolytic neurons in the ventral horn. This observation was correlated with a decreased number of motor neurons in the highly contaminated group and a decrease of \{SMN1\} protein expression (Survival of Motor Neuron 1). While contamination impairs motor neuron integrity, an increasing number of microglial cells indicates the trigger of a neuroinflammation process. Potential overexpression of a microglial recruitment chemokine, MCP-1 (Monocyte Chimioattractant Protein 1), by motor neurons themselves could mediate this process. Studies on spinal cord appear to be relevant for risk assessment of population exposed via contaminated food and water. "

abstract = "Abstract Pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus possess differential susceptibility to the ischemia-induced damage with the highest vulnerability of \{CA1\} and the lower sensitivity of \{CA3\} neurons. This damage is triggered by Ca2+-dependent excitotoxicity and can result in a delayed cell death that might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection with the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF). However, the molecular mechanisms of this neuroprotection remain poorly understood. Here we show that prolonged (30 min) oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in situ impairs intracellular Ca2+ regulation in \{CA1\} rather than in \{CA3\} neurons with the differently altered expression of genes coding Ca2+-ATPases: the mRNA level of plasmalemmal Ca2+-ATPases (PMCA1 and \{PMCA2\} subtypes) was downregulated in \{CA1\} neurons, whereas the mRNA level of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA2b subtype) was increased in \{CA3\} neurons at 4 h of re-oxygenation after prolonged OGD. These demonstrate distinct susceptibility of \{CA1\} and \{CA3\} neurons to the ischemic impairments in intracellular Ca2+ regulation and Ca2+-ATPase expression. Stabilization of HIF-1α by inhibiting HIF-1α hydroxylation prevented the ischemic decrease in both \{PMCA1\} and \{PMCA2\} mRNAs in \{CA1\} neurons, upregulated the \{SERCA2b\} mRNA level and eliminated the OGD-induced Ca2+ store dysfunction in these neurons. Cumulatively, these findings reveal the previously unknown HIF-1α-driven upregulation of Ca2+-ATPases as a mechanism opposing the ischemic impairments in intracellular Ca2+ regulation in hippocampal neurons. The ability of HIF-1α to modulate expression of genes coding Ca2+-ATPases suggests \{SERCA2b\} as a novel target for HIF-1 and may provide potential implications for HIF-1α-stabilizing strategy in activating endogenous neuroprotection.

Using these electrodes, recent studies provide novel insights into both the time domain and firing patterns of epileptic activity of single neurons. In the time domain, seizure-related activity may occur even minutes before seizure onset (in its current, EEG-based definition). Seizure-related neuronal interactions exhibit complex heterogeneous dynamics. In the seizure-onset zone, changes in firing patterns correlate with cell loss; in the penumbra, neurons maintain their spike stereotypy during a seizure. Hence, investigation of the extracellular electrical activity is expected to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease; it may, in the future, serve for a more accurate localization of the seizure focus; and it may also be employed to predict the occurrence of seizures prior to their behavioral manifestation in order to administer automatic therapeutic interventions.

Cochlear implants can functionally replace lost hair cells and stimulate the \{SGN\} electrically. The benefit from cochlear implantation depends on the number and excitability of these neurons. To identify potential therapies for \{SGN\} protection, in vitro tests are carried out on spiral ganglion cells (SGC). New method A glial cell-reduced and neuron-enhanced culture of neonatal rat \{SGC\} under mitotic inhibition (cytarabine (AraC)) for up to seven days is presented. Serum containing and neurotrophin-enriched cultures with and without AraC-addition were analyzed after 4 and 7 days. Results The total number of cells was significantly reduced, while the proportion of neurons was greatly increased by AraC-treatment. Cell type-specific labeling demonstrated that nearly all fibroblasts and most of the glial cells were removed. Neither the neuronal survival, nor the neurite outgrowth or soma diameter were negatively affected. Additionally neurites remain partly free of surrounding non-neuronal cells. Comparison with existing method Recent culture conditions allow only for short-term cultivation of neonatal \{SGC\} and lack information on the influence of non-neuronal cells on \{SGN\} and of direct contact of neurites with test-materials. Conclusions AraC-addition reduces the number of non-neuronal cells and increases the ratio of \{SGN\} in culture, without negative impact on neuronal viability. This treatment allows longer-term cultivation of \{SGC\} and provides deeper insight into SGN-glial cell interaction and the attachment of neurites on test-material surfaces. "

We established an in vitro model including the devices delivering of charge-balanced biphasic electrical stimulation, and spiral ganglion (SG) dissociated culture treated with \{BDNF\} and NT-3. After electrical stimulation with varying durations and intensities, we quantified neurite lengths and Schwann cell densities in \{SG\} cultures. Stimulations that were greater than 50 μA or longer than 8 hours significantly decreased \{SG\} neurite length. Schwann cell density under 100 μA electrical stimulation for 48 hours was significantly lower compared to that in non-stimulated group. These electrical stimulation-induced decreases of neurite extension and Schwann cell density were attenuated by various types of voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) blockers, or completely prevented by their combination, cadmium or calcium-free medium. Our study suggested that charge-balanced biphasic electrical stimulation inhibited the extension of resprouting \{SGN\} neurites and decreased Schwann cell density in vitro. Calcium influx through multiple types of \{VDCCs\} was involved in the electrical stimulation-induced inhibition. "

The most prominent neuronal subtype in the adult striatum is the medium spiny projection neuron (MSN), which constitutes &gt; 85% of all striatal neurons and classically expresses DARPP-32. Through a microarray study of genes expressed in the whole ganglionic eminence (WGE: the developing striatum) in the mouse, we identified the gene encoding the transcription factor Forkhead box protein \{P1\} (FoxP1) as the most highly up-regulated gene, thus providing unbiased evidence for the association of FoxP1 with \{MSN\} development. We also describe the expression of FoxP1 in the human fetal brain over equivalent gestational stages. FoxP1 expression persisted through into adulthood in the mouse brain, where it co-localised with all striatal DARPP-32 positive projection neurons and a small population of DARPP-32 negative cells. There was no co-localisation of FoxP1 with any interneuron markers. FoxP1 was detectable in primary fetal striatal cells following dissection, culture, and transplantation into the adult lesioned striatum, demonstrating its utility as an \{MSN\} marker for transplantation studies. Furthermore, DARPP-32 expression was absent from FoxP1 knock-out mouse \{WGE\} differentiated in vitro, suggesting that FoxP1 is important for the development of DARPP-32-positive MSNs. In summary, we show that FoxP1 labels \{MSN\} precursors prior to the expression of DARPP-32 during normal development, and in addition suggest that FoxP1 labels a sub-population of \{MSNs\} that are not co-labelled by DARPP-32. We demonstrate the utility of FoxP1 to label \{MSNs\} in vitro and following neural transplantation, and show that FoxP1 is required for DARPP-32 positive \{MSN\} differentiation in vitro. "

Although \{ET\} in peripheral systems has been well studied, little is known about \{ET\} in the brain. The present study showed that brain immune cells, microglia, being different from peripheral macrophages, displayed non-cell autonomous mechanisms in \{ET\} formation. Specifically, neurons and astroglia were indispensable for microglial ET. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) secreted from these non-immune cells was essential for governing microglial ET. Neutralization of M-CSF deprived the neuron-glia conditioned medium of its ability to enable microglia to form \{ET\} when microglia encountered two lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatments. Recombinant M-CSF protein rendered enriched microglia refractory to the second \{LPS\} challenge leading to microglial ET. Activation of microglial M-CSF receptor (M-CSFR; also known as CSF1R) and the downstream ERK1/2 signals was responsible for M-CSF-mediated microglial ET. Endotoxin-tolerant microglia in neuron-glia cultures displayed M2-like polarized phenotypes, as shown by upregulation of \{M2\} marker Arg-1, elevated production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10, and decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor α, nitric oxide, prostaglandin \{E2\} and interleukin 1β). Endotoxin-tolerant microglia protected neurons against LPS-elicited inflammatory insults, as shown by reduced neuronal damages in \{LPS\} pre-treatment group compared with the group without \{LPS\} pre-treatment. Moreover, while neurons and astroglia became injured during chronic neuroinflammation, microglia failed to form ET. Thus, this study identified a distinct non-cell autonomous mechanism of microglial ET. Interactions of M-CSF secreted by neurons and astroglia with microglial M-CSFR programed microglial ET. Loss of microglial \{ET\} could be an important pathogenetic mechanism of inflammation-associated neuronal damages. "

We previously demonstrated that paclitaxel alters neuronal sensitivity, in vitro, in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). Evidence in the literature suggests that \{NGF\} may modulate the neurotoxic effects of paclitaxel. Here, we examine whether \{NGF\} modulates changes in neuronal sensitivity and morphology induced by paclitaxel and EpoB. Neuronal sensitivity was assessed using the stimulated release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), whereas morphology of established neurites was evaluated using a high content screening system. Dorsal root ganglion cultures, maintained in the absence or presence of NGF, were treated from day 7 to day 12 in culture with paclitaxel (300 nM) or EpoB (30 nM). Following treatment, the release of \{CGRP\} was stimulated using capsaicin or high extracellular potassium. In the presence of NGF, EpoB mimicked the effects of paclitaxel: capsaicin-stimulated release was attenuated, potassium-stimulated release was slightly enhanced and the total peptide content was unchanged. In the absence of NGF, both paclitaxel and EpoB decreased capsaicin- and potassium-stimulated release and the total peptide content, suggesting that \{NGF\} may reverse MTA-induced hyposensitivity. Paclitaxel and EpoB both decreased neurite length and branching, and this attenuation was unaffected by \{NGF\} in the growth media. These differential effects of \{NGF\} on neuronal sensitivity and morphology suggest that neurite retraction is not a causative factor to alter neuronal sensitivity. "

The aim of this study was to explore the possible role of nesfatin-1 in the transmission of peripheral neural signals by investigating the effects of nesfatin-1 on intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) in cultured neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The effects of nesfatin-1 on [Ca2+]i in \{DRG\} neurons were investigated by using an in vitro calcium imaging system. \{DRG\} neurons were grown in primary culture following enzymatic and mechanical dissociation of ganglia from 1-or 2-day-old neonatal Wistar rats. Using the fura-2-based calcium imaging technique, the effects of nesfatin-1 on [Ca2+]i and role of the protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated pathway in nesfatin-1 effect were assessed. Nesfatin-1 elevated [Ca2+]i in cultured \{DRG\} neurons. The response was prevented by pretreating the cells with pertussis toxin. The protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine chloride suppressed nesfatin-1-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. The result shows that nesfatin-1 interacts with a G protein-coupled receptor, leading to an increase of [Ca2+]i, which is linked to protein kinase C activation in cultured rat \{DRG\} neurons. "

Here, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we found that propofol induced a postsynaptic outward current and dramatically suppressed the firing rates in the entorhinal stellate neurons, the axons of which form the perforant pathway and relay the main inputs to hippocampus. Propofol-induced inhibition in the \{EC\} was mediated by a dual ionic mechanism, including both \{HCN\} channel inhibition and TREK-2 channel activation, which form a subtype of two-pore-domain K+ channels. The inhibitory action of propofol observed in the \{EC\} might provide a mechanism for the anesthetic effect of propofol.

Here, we aim to elucidate the effects of orexin-A in the hippocampus (Hi) on gastric distention (GD)-sensitive neurons and gastric motility, and potential regulation mechanisms by the PeF. Retrograde tracing and fluorescent-immunohistochemical staining were used to determine orexin-A neuronal projections. Single unit discharges in the Hi were recorded extracellularly and gastric motility in conscious rats was monitored during administration of orexin-A to the Hi or electrical stimulation of the PeF. Orexin-A administration to the Hi excited most of the GD-excitatory (GD-E) neurons and GD-inhibitory (GD-I) neurons, and increased gastric motility in a dose-dependent manner. All of effects induced by orexin-A could be partly blocked by pretreatment with orexin-A antagonist, SB-334867. Electrical stimulation of the PeF excited the majority of the orexin-A-responsive \{GD\} neurons in the Hi and promoted gastric motility. Additionally, pretreatment with SB-334867 in the Hi increased the firing rate of \{GDI\} and \{GDE\} neurons following electrical stimulation of the PeF. These findings suggest that orexin-A could regulate activities of GD-sensitive neurons and gastric motility. Furthermore, the PeF may be involved in this regulatory pathway. "

The whole-cell patch-clamp experiment was performed to verify the effects of PGE2, forskolin, and GPR30-selective agonist (G-1) on action potential (AP) and tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na+ currents in identified Ah-type TGNs. The results showed that the firing frequency was increased in Ah- and C-types by PGE2, which was simulated by forskolin and inhibited by Rp-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), while G-1 mimicked this effect only in Ah-types, which was abolished by GPR30-selective antagonist (G-15). Although the amplitude of \{AP\} was increased in Ah- and C-types, increased maximal upstroke velocity was confirmed only in Ah-types, suggesting distinct alternations in current density and/or voltage-dependent property of Na+ channels. With 1.0 μM PGE2, TTX-R Na+ currents were upregulated without changing the current–voltage relationship and voltage-dependent activation in C-types, however, the TTX-R Na+ current was augmented in Ah-types, peaked voltage and the voltage-dependent activation were both shifted toward hyperpolarized direction with faster slope. Intriguingly, the low-threshold persistent TTX-R component was activated from −60 mV and increased almost double at −30 mV compared with ∼30–40% increment of TTX-R component being activated at ∼−10 mV. Additionally, the change in TTX-R component of Ah-types was equivalent well with that in C-type TGNs. Taken these data together, we conclude that \{PGE2\} modulates the neuroexcitation via cAMP-mediated upregulation of TTX-R Na+ currents in both cell-types with hormone-dependent feature, especially persistent TTX-R Na+ currents in sex-specific distribution of myelinated Ah-type TGNs.

Treatment of pure neuron cultures with 5 mM \{ATP\} for 2 h, followed by 3-h incubation in fresh medium, resulted in death of both types of neurons, and their death was prevented by administration of P2X7R-specific antagonists. In both SJL- and ddY-neurons, ATP-induced neuronal death was inhibited by a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporine A, mitochondrial dysfunction being involved in their death. The ATP-induced neuronal death was greater for SJL-neurons than for ddY-ones, this being correlated with the expression level of \{P2X7R\} in them, and the same results were obtained for the \{HEK293T\} cell systems. Co-culture of neurons with astrocytes increased the ATP-induced neuronal death compared to the case of pure neuron cultures.

First, an array of asymmetric sigmoidal neurons with symmetric inhibitory bidirectional coupling and self-coupling was considered and the bifurcations of its steady solutions were shown. Metastable dynamical transient spatially nonuniform states existed in the presence of a pair of spatially symmetric stable solutions as well as unstable spatially nonuniform solutions in a restricted range of the output gain of a neuron. The duration of the transients increased exponentially with the number of neurons up to the maximum number at which the spatially nonuniform steady solutions were stabilized. The range of the output gain for which they existed reduced as asymmetry in a sigmoidal output function of a neuron increased, while the existence range expanded as the strength of inhibitory self-coupling increased. Next, arrays of spiking neuron models with slow synaptic inhibitory bidirectional coupling and self-coupling were considered with computer simulation. In an array of Class 1 Hindmarsh–Rose type models, in which each neuron showed a graded firing rate, metastable dynamical transient firing patterns were observed in the presence of inhibitory self-coupling. This agreed with the condition for the existence of metastable dynamical transients in an array of sigmoidal neurons. In an array of Class 2 Bonhoeffer–van der Pol models, in which each neuron had a clear threshold between firing and resting, long-lasting transient firing patterns with bursting and irregular motion were observed.

Analysis of Gdf-15−/− mice has revealed that it serves the postnatal maintenance of spinal cord motor neurons and sensory neurons. In a previous study, exogenous Gdf-15 rescued 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned Gdf-15+/+ nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in vitro and in vivo. Whether endogenous Gdf-15 serves the physiological maintenance of nigrostriatal \{DAergic\} neurons in health and disease is not known and was addressed in the present study. Stereotactic injection of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) led to a significant decline in the numbers of \{DAergic\} neurons in both Gdf-15+/+ and Gdf-15−/− mice over a time-period of 14 days. However, this decrease was exacerbated in the Gdf-15−/− mice, with only 5.5% surviving neurons as compared to 24% in the Gdf-15+/+ mice. Furthermore, the microglial response to the 6-OHDA lesion was reduced in Gdf-15−/− mice, with significantly lower numbers of total and activated microglia and a differential cytokine expression as compared to the Gdf-15+/+ mice. Using in vitro models, we could demonstrate the importance of endogenous Gdf-15 in promoting \{DAergic\} neuron survival thus highlighting its relevance in a direct neurotrophic supportive role. Taken together, these results indicate the importance of Gdf-15 in promoting survival of \{DAergic\} neurons and regulating the inflammatory response post 6-OHDA lesion. "

However the mu frequency band (8–13 Hz) overlaps with the alpha frequency band, which is sensitive to attentional fluctuation, and thus mu suppression could potentially be confounded by changes in attentional engagement. The specific baseline against which mu suppression is assessed may be crucial, yet there is little consistency in how this is defined. We examined mu suppression in 61 typical adults, the largest mu suppression study so far conducted. We compared different methods of baselining, and examined activity at central and occipital electrodes, to both biological (hands) and non-biological (kaleidoscope) moving stimuli, to investigate the involvement of attention and alpha activity in mu suppression. We also examined changes in beta power, another candidate index of \{MNS\} engagement. We observed strong mu suppression restricted to central electrodes when participants performed hand movements, demonstrating that mu is indeed responsive to the activity of the motor cortex. However, when we looked for a similar signature of mu suppression to passively observed stimuli, the baselining method proved to be crucial. Selective suppression for biological versus non-biological stimuli was seen at central electrodes only when we used a within-trial baseline based on a static stimulus: this method greatly reduced trial-by-trial variation in the suppression measure compared with baselines based on blank trials presented in separate blocks. Even in this optimal condition, 16–21% of participants showed no mu suppression. Changes in beta power also did not match our predicted pattern for \{MNS\} engagement, and did not seem to offer a better measure than mu. Our conclusions are in contrast to those of a recent meta-analysis, which concluded that mu suppression is a valid means to examine mirror neuron activity. We argue that mu suppression can be used to index the human MNS, but the effect is weak and unreliable and easily confounded with alpha suppression. "

Complex nonlinear dynamics is observed when the neuron undergoes not only phase-dependent continuous weak stimulation, but also when it is driven by an external phase-independent stimulation. In the latter case basin boundaries between the synchronized and the quiet regime become complex and fractal. Simple strategies based on control pulses are not sufficient in these circumstances, because it becomes difficult to predict the dynamics of the neuron after the application of the control pulse. Therefore, a new neural control method is proposed. Initially, a weak phase control strategy is applied until fractal basin boundaries evolve into a deterministic manifold. Consequently, a single control pulse is immediately applied and the neuron evolves into the calm state. "

Considering that the amino-acid D-Aspartate has been recently shown to be an endogenous \{NMDA\} receptor agonist, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of D-Aspartate on the functional properties of nigral dopamine neurons. We compared the electrophysiological actions of D-Aspartate in control and D-aspartate oxidase gene (Ddo−/−) knock-out mice that show a concomitant increase in brain D-Aspartate levels, improved synaptic plasticity and cognition. Finally, we analyzed the effects of L-Aspartate, a known dopamine neuron endogenous agonist in control and Ddo−/− mice. We show that D- and L-Aspartate excite dopamine neurons by activating NMDA, \{AMPA\} and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Ddo deletion did not alter the intrinsic properties or dopamine sensitivity of dopamine neurons. However, NMDA-induced currents were enhanced and membrane levels of the \{NMDA\} receptor GluN1 and GluN2A subunits were increased. Inhibition of excitatory amino-acid transporters caused a marked potentiation of D-Aspartate, but not L-Aspartate currents, in Ddo−/− neurons. This is the first study to show the actions of D-Aspartate on midbrain dopamine neurons, activating not only \{NMDA\} but also non-NMDA receptors. Our data suggest that dopamine neurons, under conditions of high D-Aspartate levels, build a protective uptake mechanism to compensate for increased \{NMDA\} receptor numbers and cell hyper-excitation, which could prevent the consequent hyper-dopaminergia in target zones that can lead to neuronal degeneration, motor and cognitive alterations.

In this system both inhibitory and excitatory neurons have relevant roles. \{LMN\} loss is a marker of motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS). Conventional needle electromyography (EMG) does not allow \{LMN\} loss to be quantified. Measurement of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude or area, and the neurophysiological index, provide a surrogate estimate of the number of functional motor units. Increased motor neuronal excitability is a neurophysiological marker of \{ALS\} in the context of a suspected clinical and electrophysiological diagnosis. In the \{LMN\} system, fasciculation potentials (FPs) are the earliest changes observed in affected muscles, a feature of \{LMN\} hyperexcitability. Reinnervation is best investigated by needle \{EMG\} although other methods can be explored. Moreover needle \{EMG\} give information about the temporal profile of the reinnervation process, important ancillary data. Quantitative motor unit potential analysis is a valuable method of evaluating reinnervation. The importance of \{FPs\} has been recognized in the Awaji criteria for the electrodiagnosis of ALS, criteria that are a sensitive adjunct to the revised El Escorial criteria. Finally, functionality of LMN’s, and perhaps excitability studies in motor nerves, aids understanding of the disease process, allowing measurement of potential treatment effects in clinical trials. Other investigational techniques, such as electrical impedance myography, muscle and nerve ultrasound, and spinal cord imaging methods may prove useful in future. "

New method We have successfully standardized a method for long-term primary culture of neurons collected from post-fertilized 9 day incubated chicken embryo brain overcoming the limitations mentioned above. Fertilized eggs were incubated in the laboratory and neurons from the embryonic brain were collected and low-density culture, apparently without glial contamination, was studied at least for 35 days in vitro (DIV). Results Neurons were characterized by double immunostaining using stringent neuronal and glial markers. Neuronal differentiation, cytomorphology, neurite and axon formation, development and maturation, spine formation and synaptogenesis were tracked in real-time in a stage and time dependent manner. The neurons were transfected with Synaptophysin-RFP to label synaptic vesicles, which were followed in real-time under live-cell imaging. Comparison with existing methods Every step was carried out under controlled laboratory conditions. Eggs are easily available, easy to handle, neurons from desired day of incubation could be conveniently studied for long period in apparently glia-free condition. In addition to common factors affecting primary culture, selection of culture media and cover glass coating are other key factors affecting neuronal cultures. Conclusions We describe an inexpensive, simpler pure primary neuronal culture method for studying neuronal cell-biology, synaptogenesis, vesicular dynamics and it has potential to grow 3D-multilayered brain in vitro.

Due to this fact and regarding the random nature of the wind speed, the output power of the wind farm fluctuates randomly. Fluctuating power affects network operation and needs to be smoothed. In order to mitigate the output power fluctuations of a wind farm, a 4-step coordinated control technique based on \{ADALINE\} (ADAptive Linear NEuron) is proposed in this paper which uses a small \{BESS\} (Battery Energy Storage System) capacity. At first the on-line tracking of the \{WFOP\} (Wind Farm Output Power) is carried out by ADALINE. Afterwards, two constraints for maximum permissible fluctuations are imposed on the \{ADALINE\} output. Two states of charging feedback control strategies are implemented in the third and fourth steps. Reducing the battery capacity in proposed coordinated control technique is fulfilled through the accurate tracking performed by \{ADALINE\} and also by maintaining the level of \{BESS\} saved energy within the batteries safe performance region performed by state of charging feedback control strategies. Simulation results run by real data verify that the performance of the proposed approach is considerably better than the basic approach. "

Serum concentrations of two brain specific proteins (S100B and neuron specific enolase - NSE) were determined at inclusion. Fundoscopic exploration, brain \{MRI\} and echocardiographic studies were also performed. Clinical outcome at follow-up was registered: transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, vascular headache or migraine, cardiovascular events and death. Higher serum \{NSE\} and \{S100B\} concentrations were observed in hypertensive patients; and multiple regression analysis revealed independent associations of clinical variables and more severe white matter lesions only with \{NSE\} concentration. A panel combining two clinical variables (blood pressure &gt; 140/90 and years of hypertension &gt; 10) and serum \{NSE\} &gt; 13 μg/L predicted more severe white matter lesions with 80% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity. Higher \{NSE\} levels at inclusion were associated not only with the occurrence of vascular events related with the \{CNS\} (stroke, \{TIA\} and vascular headache), but also with an earlier presentation of these events during the follow-up period. Serum \{NSE\} concentration could be a useful biomarker to predict subclinical brain damage and future vascular events related with the \{CNS\} in hypertension.

Studies are informed by knowledge of \{DLS\} functional organization, the guiding principle being its somatotopic afferent projections from primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices. The potential to connect behaviorally relevant function to detailed structure is elevated by mouse models, which have access to extensive genetic neuroscience tool kits. Remaining to be demonstrated, however, is whether the correspondence between S1/M1 corticostriatal terminal distributions and the physiological properties of \{DLS\} neurons demonstrated in rats and non-human primates exists in mice. Given that the terminal distribution of S1/M1 projections to the \{DLS\} in mice is similar to that in rats, we studied whether firing rates (FRs) of \{DLS\} neurons in awake, behaving mice are related to activity of individual body parts. \{MSNs\} exhibited robust, selective increases in \{FR\} during movement or somatosensory stimulation of single body parts. Properties of MSNs, including baseline FRs, locations, responsiveness to stimulation, and proportions of responsive neurons were similar to properties observed in rats. Future studies can be informed by the present demonstration that the mouse lateral striatum functions as a somatic sensorimotor sector of the striatum and appears to be a homolog of the primate putamen, as demonstrated in rats (Carelli and West, 1991).

However, they often face social pressure from their \{BU\} managers to misreport. Drawing on the literature on the human mirror neuron system, this paper investigates whether controllers' ability to withstand such pressure has a neurobiological basis. We expect that mirror neuron system functionality determines controllers' inclination to succumb to social pressure exerted by self-interested managers to engage in misreporting. We measure mirror neuron system functionality using electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 29 professional controllers during an emotional expressions observation task. The controllers' inclination to misreport was measured using scenarios in which controllers were being pressed by their manager to misreport. We find a positive association between controllers' mirror neuron system functionality and their inclination to yield to managerial pressure. In line with our expectation, we find that this association existed specifically for scenarios in which managers pressed their controllers out of personal rather than organizational interests. We conclude that \{BU\} controllers’ neurobiological characteristics are involved in financial misreporting behavior and discuss the implications for accounting research and practice. "

We designed a primary neuronal cell model for severe glucose and oxygen deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate the hypoxic-ischemic condition of patients with severe stroke, trauma, or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. We evaluated the viability of these neurons following 3 h of OGD/R and variable \{MH\} conditions including different temperatures and durations of OGD/R exposure. We further explored the effects of the optimal \{MH\} condition on several parts which are associated with mitochondrial apoptosis pathway: intracellular calcium, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP). The results of this study showed that the apoptosis proportion (AP) and cell viability proportion (CVP) after OGD/R significantly varied depending on which \{MH\} condition cells were exposed to (p &lt; 0.001). Further, our findings showed that prolonged \{MH\} reduced the neuroprotection to \{AP\} and CVP. We also determined that the optimal \{MH\} conditions (34 °C for 4.5 h) reduced intracellular calcium, ROS, and recovered MTP. These findings indicate that there is an optimal \{MH\} treatment strategy for severely hypoxia-ischemic neurons, prolonged duration might diminish the neuroprotection, and that \{MH\} treatment likely initiates neuroprotection by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

The current study assessed whether a central component of social cognition, emotion processing, would influence the \{MNS\} activity to trained visuomotor associations, which could support a broader role of the \{MNS\} in social cognition. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed repetition suppression to the presentation of stimulus pairs involving a simple hand action and a geometric shape that was either congruent or incongruent with earlier association training. Each pair was preceded by an image of positive, negative, or neutral emotionality. In support of an associative learning account of the MNS, repetition suppression was greater for trained pairs compared with untrained pairs in several regions, primarily supplementary motor area (SMA) and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). This response, however, was not modulated by the valence of the emotional images. These findings argue against a fundamental role of emotion processing in the mirror neuron response, and are inconsistent with theoretical accounts linking mirror neurons to social cognition. "

The progressive and selective degeneration of these neurons is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The susceptibility of \{DA\} neurons in the \{SNpc\} may result from differences in how Ca2+ is handled. However, very little information is available about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in \{DA\} neurons. In this study, the relative contributions of various Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and their interplay with internal Ca2+ stores, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria, in the regulation of the [Ca2+]i of mouse mesencephalic neurons were characterized. Both the K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCKX) and the K+-independent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) can be detected and are functional in \{DA\} and non-DA neurons. \{NCX\} accounts for the larger component of Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. Single-cell RT-PCR analysis showed each individual neuron expressed a distinct set of the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. Furthermore, the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers play prominent roles in removing [Ca2+]i induced by glutamate but not [Ca2+]i induced by depolarization. The mitochondria serve as a major Ca2+ sink and are functionally located close to NCX. In contrast, the \{ER\} is functionally located close to \{NCKX\} and acts primarily as a Ca2+ source with marginal effects. This study reveals that the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, the \{ER\} and the mitochondria, which cooperate interactively, act similarly when regulating [Ca2+]i in mesencephalic \{DA\} and non-DA neurons. The heterogeneous expression of multiple types of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and the quantitative differences found in [Ca2+]i regulation, together with other risk factors specific to \{DA\} neurons such as dopamine oxidation resulting in oxidative stress, may drive these cells to undergo selective degeneration.

Cochlear implants (CIs), which bypass the lost \{HC\} function by direct electrical stimulation of the remaining auditory neurons, offer an effective therapy option. Several studies imply that components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) have a great impact on the adhesion and growth of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) during development. Based on these findings, \{ECM\} proteins might act as bioactive \{CI\} substrates to optimize the electrode–nerve interface and to improve efficacy of these implants. In the present study, we focused on the \{ECM\} glycoproteins Tenascin-C (TN-C), Laminin (LN), and Fibronectin (FN), which show a prominent expression along the growth route of \{SGNs\} and the niche around \{HCs\} during murine postnatal development in vivo. We compared their influence on adhesion, neurite length, and neurite number of \{SGNs\} in vitro. Moreover, we studied the expression of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) dermatan sulfate-dependent proteoglycan-1 (DSD-1-PG), an interaction partner of TN-C. In sum, our in vitro data suggest that TN-C acts as an anti-adhesive and inhibitory factor for the growth of SGNs. The DSD-1 carbohydrate epitope is specifically localized to \{HC\} stereocilia and \{SG\} fibers. Interestingly, TN-C and the DSD-1-PG exhibit a mutually exclusive expression pattern, with the exception of a very restricted region beneath the habenula perforata, where \{SG\} neurites grow through the basilar membrane (BM) toward the HCs. The complementary expression of TN-C, LN, FN, and the DSD-1 epitope suggests that TN-C may act as an important boundary formation molecule in the developing postnatal mouse inner ear, which makes it a promising candidate to regulate neurite outgrowth in the light of CIs.

Neurotoxic modifications mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are closely associated with the destruction of key macromolecules and inactivation of antioxidant enzymes, which compromises antioxidant defenses. Approaches to expel ROS/RNS and alleviate toxic oxidative/nitrosative stress in neurons have not completely been defined. Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of various antioxidants that serve as the neuroprotectors under a toxic stress created by \{ROS\} plus nitric oxide (NO). Sublytic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plus \{NO\} donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D, l-penicillamine (SNAP) enabled to induce a toxic oxidative/nitrosative stress through activating both p38 \{MAPK\} and p53 cascades, and cause \{DNA\} damage and protein tyrosine nitration in primary neuronal cultures. After comparing six antioxidants, including superoxide dimutase (SOD), catalase, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinoxyl (TEMPO), N-acetylcysteine, dimethylthiourea, and uric acid, \{TEMPO\} was the superior antioxidant that comprehensively and efficaciously decreased \{H2O2\} plus SNAP-evoked activation of stress cascades of p38 \{MAPK\} and p53, production of NO, ROS, and peroxynitrite, double-strand breaks of DNA, and nitration of protein tyrosine residues. \{SOD\} increased the peroxynitrite formation and was unable to reduce the level of protein nitration. All antioxidants tested, except SOD, effectively reduced neuronal damage and \{DNA\} breakage caused by the toxic H2O2/SNAP combination. In conclusion, these results suggest that \{TEMPO\} ensures excellent ROS/RNS clearance and stress-signaling inhibition, thus effectively rescuing neurons from ROS/H2O2 plus NO/SNAP-induced insult. This study reveals a potential strategy for nitroxide antioxidants as a therapeutic agent against oxidative/nitrosative neurotoxicity. "

First, \{PRL\} dose-dependently increased the amplitude of \{ASIC\} currents with an \{EC50\} of (5.89 ± 0.28) × 10−8 M. \{PRL\} potentiation of \{ASIC\} currents was also pH dependent. Second, \{PRL\} potentiation of \{ASIC\} currents was blocked by Δ1-9-G129R-hPRL, a \{PRL\} receptor antagonist, and removed by intracellular dialysis of either protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, protein interacting with C-kinase 1(PICK1) inhibitor FSC-231, or \{PI3K\} inhibitor AS605240. Third, \{PRL\} altered acidosis-evoked membrane excitability of \{DRG\} neurons and caused a significant increase in the amplitude of the depolarization and the number of spikes induced by acid stimuli. Four, \{PRL\} exacerbated nociceptive responses to injection of acetic acid in female rats. Finally, \{PRL\} displayed a stronger effect on \{ASIC\} mediated-currents and nociceptive behavior in intact female rats than \{OVX\} female and male rats and thus modulation of \{PRL\} may be gender-dependent. These results suggest that \{PRL\} up-regulates the activity of \{ASICs\} and enhances \{ASIC\} mediated nociceptive responses in female rats, which reveal a novel peripheral mechanism underlying \{PRL\} involvement in hyperalgesia.

Subsequent inactivation is performed by 24-hydroxylation. These reactions are carried out by a series of \{CYP450\} enzymes. The 25-hydroxylation involves mainly \{CYP2R1\} and CYP27A1, whereas 1α-hydroxylation and 24-hydroxylation are catalyzed by \{CYP27B1\} and CYP24A1, respectively, and are tightly regulated to maintain adequate levels of the active vitamin D hormone, 1α,25(OH)2D3. Altered circulating vitamin D levels, in particular 25(OH)D3, have been linked to several disorders of the nervous system, e.g., schizophrenia and Parkinson disease. However, little is known about the mechanisms of vitamin D actions in the neurons. In this study, we examined vitamin D metabolism and its regulation in a murine motor neuron-like hybrid cell line, NSC-34. We found that these cells express mRNAs for the four major \{CYP450\} enzymes involved in vitamin D activation and inactivation, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) that mediates vitamin D actions. We also found high levels of CYP24A1-dependent 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin \{D3\} [24,25(OH)2D3] production, that was inhibited by the well-known \{CYP\} enzyme inhibitor ketoconazole and by several inhibitors that are more specific for CYP24A1.

We find that the proportion of \{C1\} pSer40TH-positive neurons in the central and medial region of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) increases dramatically following hydralazine treatment, whereas phenylephrine treatment does not significantly change the pSer40TH/TH ratio in these regions compared to control.

Overall, we conclude first, that our newly characterized monoclonal antibodies are specific, and selective, against \{TH\} and pSer40TH. Secondly, that they can be used to label \{TH\} and pSer40TH immunoreactive neurons simultaneously, and thirdly that that they can be used to identify the activation state of catecholamine synthetizing neurons after physiological stimuli. Finally, we find that there is basal level of activation of \{TH\} neurons in the lateral, central and medial regions (∼70%, 30% and 45%, respectively) of the \{C1\} area, but that following unloading of the baroreceptors there is a marked increase in activation of central (∼80%) and medial (∼90%) \{C1\} neurons in the RVLM.

We recently showed that terminal Schwann cells (TSCs) exhibit abnormalities in postnatal mice that express mutations of the \{SOD1\} enzyme found in inherited human motor neuron disease. \{TSC\} abnormalities appeared before disease-related denervation commenced and the extent of \{TSC\} abnormality at \{P30\} correlated with the extent of subsequent denervation. Denervated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) were also observed that lacked any labeling for TSCs. This suggested that \{SOD1\} \{TSCs\} may respond differently than wildtype \{TSCs\} to denervation which remain at denervated \{NMJs\} for several months. In the present study, the response of \{SOD1\} \{TSCs\} to experimental denervation was examined. At \{P30\} and P60, SC-specific \{S100\} labeling was quickly lost from \{SOD1\} \{NMJs\} and from preterminal regions. Evidence indicates that this loss eventually becomes complete at most \{SOD1\} \{NMJs\} before reinnervation occurs. The loss of labeling was not specific for \{S100\} and did not depend on loss of activity. Although some post-denervation labeling loss occurred at wildtype NMJs, this loss was never complete. Soon after denervation, large cells appeared near \{SOD1\} \{NMJ\} bands which colabeled for \{SC\} markers as well as for activated caspase-3 suggesting that distal \{SOD1\} \{SCs\} may experience cell death following denervation. Denervated \{SOD1\} \{NMJs\} viewed 7 days after denervation with the electron microscope confirmed the absence of \{TSCs\} overlying endplates. These observations demonstrate that \{SOD1\} \{TSCs\} and distal \{SCs\} respond abnormally to denervation. This behavior can be expected to hinder reinnervation and raises further questions concerning the ability of \{SOD1\} \{TSCs\} to support normal functioning of motor terminals. "

We sought to determine the influence of peripheral hormones on the \{AR\} expression in Purkinje neurons across cerebellar lobules in the vermis of male rats. First, we found a basal \{AR\} expression in Purkinje neurons that was higher in the superficial region than the deep region only in cerebellar lobules 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9. Moreover, only the cerebellar lobule 10 showed a significant difference between the coordinates 0.1, 0.3 and 0.9. Second, males with four sessions of sexual training showed a decreased \{AR\} density in cerebellar lobules 7, 8, 9 and 10, but not in lobules 2, 4 or 5 when compared to males with one session of sexual training. However, sexual training did not affect \{AR\} expression in Purkinje neurons according to their location in any of the cerebellar lobules studied. Third, castration decreased the \{AR\} density in the cerebellar lobules 1, 2, 5 and 9 in the superficial region, while in the deep region all cerebellar lobules, except lobule 6, showed a lower \{AR\} density after castration. Finally, testosterone replacement restored \{AR\} density to control levels in all cerebellar lobules in the superficial region that were affected by castration. Contrary, in the deep region hormonal replacement failed to restore the \{AR\} density to control level in the majority of the cerebellar lobules that were affected by castration. Altogether, our findings indicate that Purkinje neurons in the vermis are influenced by systemic testosterone in a region-dependent manner highlighting a link between the cerebellum and gonads in the male rat. The \{AR\} function in Purkinje neurons may be related to cerebellar plasticity since both estrogen and progesterone receptors, members of the nuclear receptor family, regulate plasticity processes in Purkinje neurons. We concluded the cerebellum is an important component of the neural circuit for male sexual behavior. "

The Kv2.1 potassium channel was the major component of delayed rectifier potassium current (Ik) in pyramidal neurons in cortex and hippocampus. The neuronal protective effect of propofol has been proved. Delayed rectifier potassium current (Ik) has been shown to have close relationship with neuronal damage. The study was designed to test the inhibitory effect of propofol on Kv2.1 potassium channel in rat parietal cortical neurons. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings and Western blot analysis were used to investigate the electrophysiological function and protein expression of Kv2.1 in rat parietal cortical neurons after propofol treatment. We found that propofol concentration-dependently inhibited Ik in pyramidal neurons. Propofol also caused a downward shift of the I–V curve of Ik at 30 μM concentration. Propofol significantly inhibited the expression of Kv2.1 protein level at 30 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM concentration. In conclusion, our data showed that propofol could inhibit Ik, probably via depressing the expression of Kv2.1 protein in rat cerebral parietal cortical neurons. "

We assessed the molecular and cellular composition of the developing olfactory and otic placodes, and cranial sensory ganglia to evaluate contributions of ectodermal placode versus neural crest at each site. Special sensory neuron populations—the olfactory and otic placodes, as well as those in vestibulo-acoustic ganglion- are entirely populated with cells expressing cranial placode-associated, rather than neural crest-associated markers. The remaining cranial sensory ganglia are a mosaic of cells that express placode-associated as well as neural crest-associated markers. We found two distinct populations of neural crest in the cranial ganglia: the first, as expected, is labeled by Wnt1:Cre mediated recombination. The second is not labeled by Wnt1:Cre recombination, and expresses both Sox10 and FoxD3. These populations—Wnt1:Cre recombined, and Sox10/Foxd3-expressing— are proliferatively distinct from one another. Together, the two neural crest-associated populations are substantially more proliferative than their placode-associated counterparts. Nevertheless, the apparently placode- and neural crest-associated populations are similarly sensitive to altered signaling that compromises cranial morphogenesis and differentiation. Acute disruption of either Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) or Retinoic acid (RA) signaling alters axon growth and cell death, but does not preferentially target any of the three distinct populations. Apparently, mosaic derivation and diversity of precursors and early differentiating neurons, modulated uniformly by local signals, supports early cranial sensory neuron differentiation and growth. "

Second, the \{MCP\} mouse was made to express the NLS-HA-MCP-GFP transgene in all cell types. By crossing Actb-MBS and \{MCP\} mice, a double homozygous mouse line, \{MCP\} × MBS, was established to visualize endogenous β-actin mRNA labeled with multiple green fluorescent proteins. By imaging hippocampal neurons or brain slices from \{MCP\} × \{MBS\} mice, the dynamics of mRNA, such as transcription, transport, and localization, can be studied at single mRNA resolution.

Yet the major limitations of this model are the lengthy differentiation procedure and its low efficiency, although recent studies suggest that the differentiation process can be shortened to less than 1 week using nucleoside analogues. To explore whether short-term exposure of \{NT2\} cells to the nucleoside analogue cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (AraC) could be a suitable method to efficiently generate mature neurons, we conducted a neurochemical and morphometric characterization of AraC-differentiated \{NT2N\} (AraC/NT2N) neurons and improved the differentiation efficiency by modifying the cell culture schedule. Moreover, we analyzed the neurotransmitter phenotypes of AraC/NT2N neurons. Cultures obtained by treatment with AraC were highly enriched in postmitotic neurons and essentially composed of dual glutamatergic/cholinergic neurons, which contrasts with the preferential \{GABAergic\} phenotype that we found after \{RA\} differentiation. Taken together, our results further reinforce the notion \{NT2\} cells are a versatile source of neuronal phenotypes and provide a new encouraging platform for studying mechanisms of neuronal differentiation and for exploring neuronal replacement strategies.

Owing to the scarcity of human neurons, the pathological role of \{LAMP2\} deficiency in neural injury of humans remains largely elusive. However, the application of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may shed light on overcoming such scarcity. In this study, we obtained iPSCs derived from a patient carrying a mutated \{LAMP2\} gene that is associated with Danon disease. By differentiating such LAMP2-deficient iPSCs into cerebral cortical neurons and with the aid of various biochemical assays, we demonstrated that the LAMP2-deficient neurons are more susceptible to mild oxidative stress-induced injury. The data from \{MTT\} assay and apoptotic analysis demonstrated that there was no notable difference in cellular viability between the normal and LAMP2-deficient neurons under non-stressed condition. When exposed to mild oxidative stress (10 μM H2O2), the LAMP2-deficient neurons exhibited a significant increase in apoptosis. Surprisingly, we did not observe any aberrant accumulation of autophagic materials in the LAMP2-deficient neurons under such stress condition. Our results from cellular fractionation and inhibitor blockade experiments further revealed that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the LAMP2-deficient cortical neurons was caused by increased abundance of cytosolic cathepsin L. These results suggest the involvement of lysosomal membrane permeabilization in the \{LAMP2\} deficiency associated neural injury. "

The increase of \{KM\} by a factor of 2.4 during the first four measurement cycles is attributed to partial denaturation of the enzyme. The AcFETs were used to record the release of acetylcholine (ACh) by neuronal tissue cultivated on the gate area upon stimulation by rising the extracellular K+ concentration. The neuronal tissue constituted of isolated myenteric neurons from four to 12 days old Wistar rats, or sections from the muscularis propria containing the myenteric plexus from adult rats. For both cases the AcFET response was demonstrated to be related to the activity of the immobilized acetylcholinesterase using the reversible acetylcholinesterase blocker donepezil. A concentration response curve of this blocking agent revealed a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 40 nM which is comparable to values measured by complementary in vitro methods. "

As autaptic delay is varied, the spiking behaviors of the neurons intermittently become synchronous and non-synchronous, and meanwhile they are ordered and disordered, exhibiting both synchronization transitions (ST) and multiple coherence resonance (MCR). Moreover, the autaptic delays for \{CR\} and synchronization are close. When coupling strength or network randomness increases, or when channel noise intensity decreases, \{MCR\} is enhanced, but \{ST\} becomes strongest at optimal coupling strength, network randomness, or channel noise intensity. These results show that autaptic activity can induce both \{MCR\} and \{ST\} in the neuronal networks. This implies that autaptic activity can simultaneously enhance or reduce the temporal coherence and synchronization of the neuronal network. These findings could find potential implications for the information processing and transmission in neural systems. "

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a master gene for mitochondrial biogenesis and has been shown to be neuroprotective in models of PD. In this work we have studied the mechanisms by which peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) selective agonist N-(2-benzoylphenyl)-O-[2-(methyl-2-pyridinylamino)ethyl]-l-tyrosine hydrate (GW1929) acts on human dopaminergic neurons in culture. Data showed that \{GW1929\} increased the viability of human dopaminergic neurons and protected them against oxidative stress induced by \{H2O2\} and the mitochondrial toxin Rotenone. The enhanced resilience of the neurons was attributed to increased levels of mitochondrial antioxidants and of PGC-1α. \{GW1929\} treatment further increased cell respiration, mitochondrial biogenesis and sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) expression in the human dopaminergic neurons. Phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) was also robustly increased in GW1929-treated cells. Together these results show that the PPARγ agonist \{GW1929\} influences \{CREB\} signaling and PGC-1α activities in the human dopaminergic neurons contributing to an increased cell viability. This supports the view that drugs acting on the PPARγ-PGC-1α signaling in neurons may have beneficial effects in \{PD\} and possible also in other brain disorders. "

Consequently, neurogenesis of this group of neurons in the adult brain has drawn considerable interest for the purpose of harnessing endogenous neurogenerative potential as well as devising better strategies for stem cell therapy for PD. However, the existence of adult neurogenesis for \{DA\} neurons within the \{SN\} remains controversial. To overcome technical and design limitations associated with previous studies, our group has developed a novel genetic mouse model for assessing adult nigral \{DA\} neurogenesis. This system utilizes transgenic mice that express a tamoxifen-activatable Cre recombinase (CreERT2) under the control of the neuronal progenitor cell promoters nestin or Sox2 leading to suppression of the \{DA\} neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) via excision of exon 1 by flanking loxP sites in adult animals. This study reports that six months following initiation of a six week treatment with tamoxifen mice with nestin-mediated Th excision displayed a significant reduction in TH+ neurons in the SN. This finding indicates that nestin-expressing cells regenerate \{DA\} neurons within the \{SN\} of adult animals. Interestingly, no reduction was observed in TH+ cells following Sox2-mediated Th excision suggesting that a nestin+/SOX2− precursor cell population drives \{DA\} neurogenesis in the adult SN. This information represents a substantial leap in current knowledge of adult \{DA\} neurogenesis, will enable improved in vitro and in vivo modeling, as well as facilitate the harnessing of this process for therapeutic intervention for PD.

The results suggest that \{ANNs\} are significantly better than \{LNL\} and Wiener models in predicting specific neural responses to Gaussian White Noise, but not significantly different when tested with sinusoidal inputs. They are also able to predict responses of the same neuron in different individuals irrespective of which animal was used to develop the model, although notable differences between some individuals were evident.

In our study, we have attempted to clarify how oxidative damage induces dose dependent changes in functional membrane properties of neurons by means of whole cell patch clamp techniques in brain slices from young adult rats. Our research demonstrates physiological changes in membrane properties of pyramidal motor cortex neurons exposed to 3 concentrations of cumene hydroperoxide (CH; 1, 10 and 100 μM) during 30 min. Results show that oxidative stress induced by \{CH\} evokes important changes, in a concentration and time dependent manner, in the neuronal excitability of motor cortex neurons of the rat: (i) Low concentration of the drug (1 μM) already blocks inward rectifications (sag) and decreases action potential amplitude and gain, a drug concentration which has no effects on other neuronal populations, (ii) 10 μM of \{CH\} depresses the excitability of pyramidal motor cortex neurons by decreasing input resistance, amplitude of the action potential, and gain and maximum frequency of the repetitive firing discharge, and (iii) 100 μM completely blocks the capability to produce repetitive discharge of action potentials in all cells. Both larger drug concentrations and/or longer times of exposure to \{CH\} narrow the current working range. This happens because of the increase in the rheobase, and the reduction of the cancelation current. The effects caused by oxidative stress, including those produced by the level of lipid peroxidation, are practically irreversible and, this, therefore, indicates that neuroprotective agents should be administered at the first symptoms of alterations to membrane properties. In fact, the pre-treatment with melatonin, acting as an antioxidant, prevented the lipid peroxidation and the physiological changes induced by CH. Larger cells (as estimated by their cell capacitance) were also more susceptible to oxidative stress. Our results provide previously unavailable observations that large size and high sensitivity to oxidative stress (even at low concentrations) make pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex, in particular corticofugal neurons, more susceptible to cell death when compared with other neuronal populations. These results could also shed some light on explaining the causes behind diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. "

abstract = "Abstract Amitriptyline, carbamazepine and gabapentin are often used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. However, their analgesic action on central sensory neurons is still not fully understood. Moreover, the expression pattern of their target ion channels is poorly elucidated in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Thus, we performed patch-clamp investigations in visualized neurons of lamina I–III of the spinal cord. The expression of the different voltage-gated ion channels, as the targets of these drugs, was detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Neurons of the lamina I–III express the TTX-sensitive voltage-gated Na+ as well as voltage-gated K+ subunits assembling the fast inactivating (A-type) currents and the delayed rectifier K+ currents. Our pharmacological studies show that tonically-firing, adapting-firing and single spike neurons responded dose-dependently to amitriptyline and carbamazepine. The ion channel inhibition consecutively reduced the firing rate of tonically-firing and adapting-firing neurons. This study provides evidence for the distribution of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ subunits in lamina I–III of the spinal cord and for the action of drugs used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Our work confirms that modulation of voltage-gated ion channels in the central nervous system contributes to the antinociceptive effects of these drugs. "

One such target recently proposed from the effects of auto-immune IgGs on Ca2 + transients in cardiac myocytes and cell lines is the α1-adrenoceptor. We have tested whether such IgGs exerted comparable effects on nociceptive sensory neurons isolated from rat dorsal root ganglia. Depolarisation-induced [Ca2 +]i transients were generated by applying 30 mM \{KCl\} for 2 min and monitored by Fura-2 fluorescence imaging. No IgGs tested (including 3 from \{CRPS\} patients) had any significant effect on these [Ca2 +]i transients. However, IgG from one \{CRPS\} patient consistently and significantly reduced the K+-induced response of cells that had been pre-incubated for 24 h with a mixture of inflammatory mediators (1 μM histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, bradykinin and PGE2). Since this pre-incubation also appeared to induce a comparable inhibitory response to the α1-agonist phenylephrine, this is compatible with the α1-adrenoceptor as a target for \{CRPS\} auto-immunity. A mechanism whereby this might enhance pain is suggested. "

Here we specifically knocked down dFIG4 in various tissues, and investigated their phenotypes. Neuron-specific knockdown of dFIG4 resulted in axonal targeting aberrations of photoreceptor neurons, shortened presynaptic terminals of motor neurons in 3rd instar larvae and reduced climbing ability in adulthood and life span. Fat body-specific knockdown of dFIG4 resulted in enlarged lysosomes in cells that were detected by staining with LysoTracker. In addition, eye imaginal disk-specific knockdown of dFIG4 disrupted differentiation of pupal ommatidial cell types, such as cone cells and pigment cells, suggesting an additional role of dFIG4 during eye development.

Neuronal enteric dysfunction is a feature of many direct gastrointestinal disorders and can be secondary to central nervous system disorders. Research in this field has been limited and there are few published methods on dissociated enteric cultures. New method Here we describe a quick and efficient method for culturing myenteric neurons which optimizes neuronal yield. A simplified technique is presented to easily dissect the myenteric plexus and longitudinal muscle from the outside of the intestinal wall reducing non-neuronal cell and bacterial contamination from the final culture. These segments are subjected to enzymatic dissociation and the resulting neurons are placed into an optimal growth media for long term culture. Results This protocol produces a high yield of neuronal cells. Multiple neuronal subtypes reflecting the in vivo population are observed. Cultures are optimal at 3 weeks in vitro but can be sustained for at least 5 weeks. Comparison with existing methods Unlike other protocols our method does not require a time consuming challenging dissection, long enzymatic treatment times or the use of specialized equipment. Resulting cultures are of higher quality and can be sustained longer permitting proper neuronal recovery. In addition cell attachment to culture substrates have been optimized. Conclusion We provide a novel method for researchers to dissociate and grow high quality enteric neuronal cultures. Our method can be used for studies on gastrointestinal diseases caused by enteric neuronal dysfunction and to explore possible pharmacological interventions in vitro. "

The Notch pathway inhibits the differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells and Lingo-1 is a strong negative regulator for myelination and axon growth. While Lingo-1 shRNA and N-[N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alanyl]-S-Phenylglycinet-butylester (DAPT), a Notch pathway inhibitor, have been used separately to help repair SCI, the results have been unsatisfactory. Here we investigated and elucidated the preliminary mechanism for the effect of Lingo-1 shRNA and \{DAPT\} on neural stem/progenitor cells differentiation. We found that neural stem/progenitor cells from \{E14\} rat embryos expressed Nestin, Sox-2 and Lingo-1, and we optimized the transduction of neural stem/progenitor cells using lentiviral vectors encoding Lingo-1 shRNA. The addition of \{DAPT\} decreased the expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) as well as the downstream genes Hes1 and Hes5. Expression of NeuN, \{CNPase\} and \{GFAP\} in \{DAPT\} treated cells and expression of NeuN in Lingo-1 shRNA treated cells confirmed differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells into neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. These results revealed that while Lingo-1 shRNA and Notch signaling inhibitor \{DAPT\} both promoted differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons, only \{DAPT\} was capable of driving neural stem/progenitor cells differentiation into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Since we were able to show that both Lingo-1 shRNA and \{DAPT\} could drive neural stem/progenitor cells differentiation, our data might aid the development of more effective \{SCI\} therapies using Lingo-1 shRNA and DAPT.

Three main types of glial cells are found in the mammalian retina that serve to maintain retinal homeostasis: astrocytes, Müller cells and resident microglia. Müller cells, astrocytes and microglia not only provide structural support but they are also involved in metabolism, the phagocytosis of neuronal debris, the release of certain transmitters and trophic factors and K+ uptake. Astrocytes are mostly located in the nerve fibre layer and they accompany the blood vessels in the inner nuclear layer. Indeed, like Müller cells, astrocytic processes cover the blood vessels forming the retinal blood barrier and they fulfil a significant role in ion homeostasis. Among other activities, microglia can be stimulated to fulfil a macrophage function, as well as to interact with other glial cells and neurons by secreting growth factors. This review summarizes the main functional relationships between retinal glial cells and neurons, presenting a general picture of the retina recently modified based on experimental observations. The preferential involvement of the distinct glia cells in terms of the activity in the retina is discussed, for example, while Müller cells may serve as progenitors of retinal neurons, astrocytes and microglia are responsible for synaptic pruning. Since different types of glia participate together in certain activities in the retina, it is imperative to explore the order of redundancy and to explore the heterogeneity among these cells. Recent studies revealed the association of glia cell heterogeneity with specific functions. Finally, the neuroprotective effects of glia on photoreceptors and ganglion cells under normal and adverse conditions will also be explored. "

Not all neurons in the \{A9\} subregions degenerate in PD, and the dopaminergic (DA) neurons located in the neighboring ventral tegmental area (A10) are relatively resistant to \{PD\} pathogenesis. An increasing number of quantitative studies using human tissue samples of these brain regions have revealed important biological differences. In this review, we first describe current knowledge on the multi-segmental neuromere origin of these \{DA\} neurons. We then compare the continued transcription factor and protein expression profile and morphological differences distinguishing subregions within the \{A9\} substantia nigra, and between \{A9\} and \{A10\} \{DA\} neurons. We conclude that the expression of three types of factors and proteins contributes to the diversity observed in these \{DA\} neurons and potentially to their differential vulnerability to PD. In particular, the specific axonal structure of \{A9\} neurons and the way \{A9\} neurons maintain their \{DA\} usage makes them easily exposed to energy deficits, calcium overload and oxidative stress, all contributing to their decreased survival in PD. We highlight knowledge gaps in our understanding of the cellular biomarkers for and their different functions in \{DA\} neurons, knowledge which may assist to identify underpinning disease mechansims that could be targeted for the treatment of any subregional dysfunction and loss of these \{DA\} neurons.

This limited spontaneous functional recovery has been attributed, to a large extent, to the plasticity of propriospinal neurons, especially the descending propriospinal neurons (dPSNs). Compared with the supraspinal counterparts, dPSNs have displayed significantly greater regenerative capacity, which can be further enhanced by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). In the present study, we applied a G-mutated rabies virus (G-Rabies) co-expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) to reveal Golgi-like dendritic morphology of dPSNs. We also investigated the neurotransmitters expressed by dPSNs after labeling with a retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG). dPSNs were examined in animals with sham injuries or complete spinal transections with or without \{GDNF\} treatment. Bilateral injections of G-Rabies and \{FG\} were made into the 2nd lumbar (L2) spinal cord at 3 days prior to a spinal cord transection performed at the 11th thoracic level (T11). The lesion gap was filled with Gelfoam containing either saline or \{GDNF\} in the injury groups. Four days post-injury, the rats were sacrificed for analysis. For those animals receiving G-rabies injection, the \{GFP\} signal in the T7-9 spinal cord was visualized via 2-photon microscopy. Dendritic morphology from stack images was traced and analyzed using a Neurolucida software. We found that dPSNs in sham injured animals had a predominantly dorsal-ventral distribution of dendrites. Transection injury resulted in alterations in the dendritic distribution with dorsal-ventral retraction and lateral-medial extension. Treatment with \{GDNF\} significantly increased the terminal dendritic length of dPSNs. The density of spine-like structures was increased after injury, and treatment with \{GDNF\} enhanced this effect. For the group receiving \{FG\} injections, immunohistochemistry for glutamate, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), glycine, and \{GABA\} was performed in the T7-9 spinal cord. We show that the majority of \{FG\} retrogradely-labeled dPSNs were located in the Rexed Lamina VII. Over 90% of FG-labeled neurons were glutamatergic, with the other three neurotransmitters contributing less than 10% of the total. To our knowledge this is the first report describing the morphologic characteristics of dPSNs and their neurotransmitter expressions, as well as the dendritic response of dPSNs after transection injury and \{GDNF\} treatment.

Our simulations demonstrated that the numerically observed behaviors were in excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted results. In addition, using numerically simulations, we investigated the effects of τ and β , as well as the diffusion on dynamic behavior. Our numerical results showed that the addition diffusion to a stable delay-differential equation (DDE) system may make it unstable and that the diffusion may make the system synchronous, whereas it is asynchronous without the diffusion term.

The chromatin regulator Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is subjected to \{PTMs\} including SUMO. Mutations in MeCP2 lead to Rett syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Here, we present an efficient method to perform sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (Seq-ChIP) for detecting \{SUMOylated\} MeCP2 in neurons. This Seq-ChIP technique is a useful tool to determine the occupancy of \{SUMOylated\} transcription and chromatin factors at specific genomic regions. "

Orexin-A is an excitatory neuropeptide that regulates arousal, wakefulness and appetite. Recent studies have shown that orexin-A may promote gastric motility. We aim to explore the effects of orexin-A on the gastric -distension (GD) sensitive neurons and gastric motility in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), and the possible regulation by the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Extracellular single unit discharges were recorded and the gastric motility was monitored by administration of orexin-A into the \{LHA\} and electrical stimulation of the PVN. There were \{GD\} neurons in the LHA, and administration of orexin-A to the \{LHA\} could increase the firing rate of both GD-excitatory (GD-E) and GD-inhibited (GD-I) neurons. The gastric motility was significantly enhanced by injection of orexin-A into the \{LHA\} with a dose dependent manner, which could be completely abolished by pre-treatment with orexin-A receptor antagonist SB334867. Electrical stimulation of the \{PVN\} could significantly increase the firing rate of \{GD\} neurons responsive to orexin-A in the \{LHA\} as well as promote gastric motility of rats. However, those effects could be partly blocked by pre-treatment with \{SB334867\} in the LHA. It is suggested that orexin-A plays an important role in promoting gastric motility via LHA. The \{PVN\} may be involved in regulation of \{LHA\} on gastric motility. "

Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we address this problem by utilizing artificial neural networks (NNs) as agent controllers, and mechanisms such as neuromodulation and synaptic gating. The novel aspect of this work is the introduction of a type of artificial neuron we call “switch neuron”. A switch neuron regulates the flow of information in \{NNs\} by selectively gating all but one of its incoming synaptic connections, effectively allowing only one signal to propagate forward. The allowed connection is determined by the switch neuron’s level of modulatory activation which is affected by modulatory signals, such as signals that encode some information about the reward received by the agent. An important aspect of the switch neuron is that it can be used in appropriate “switch modules” in order to modulate other switch neurons. As we show, the introduction of the switch modules enables the creation of sequences of gating events. This is achieved through the design of a modulatory pathway capable of exploring in a principled manner all permutations of the connections arriving on the switch neurons. We test the model by presenting appropriate architectures in nonstationary binary association problems and T-maze tasks. The results show that for all tasks, the switch neuron architectures generate optimal adaptive behaviors, providing evidence that the switch neuron model could be a valuable tool in simulations where behavioral plasticity is required.

FGF-2 is essential for survival of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons and is responsible for their dysplasia and disease-related degeneration. We previously reported that FGF-2 is involved in adequate forebrain (FB) target innervation by these neurons in an organotypic co-culture model. It remains unclear, how this ex-vivo phenotype relates to the in vivo situation, and which FGF-related signaling pathway is involved in this process. Here, we demonstrate that lack of FGF-2 results in an increased volume of the striatal target area in mice. We further add evidence that the low molecular weight (LMW) FGF-2 isoform is responsible for this phenotype, as this isoform is predominantly expressed in the embryonic ventral midbrain (VM) as well as in postnatal striatum (STR) and known to act via canonical transmembrane \{FGF\} receptor (FGFR) activation. Additionally, we confirm that the phenotype with an enlarged FB-target area by \{DA\} neurons can be mimicked in an ex-vivo explant model by inhibiting the canonical \{FGFR\} signaling, which resulted in decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, while \{AKT\} activation remained unchanged.

Experimental \{MIA\} was produced by an injection of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) into pregnant rats on gestational day (GD) 10 or GD19. A separate control group received saline injections. The density of neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN+) and somatostatin (SST+) \{IWMNs\} was determined in the white matter of the corpus callosum in two rostrocaudally adjacent areas in the 12 week old offspring of \{GD10\} (n = 10) or \{GD19\} polyI:C dams (n = 18) compared to controls (n = 20). NeuN+ \{IWMN\} density trended to be higher in offspring from dams exposed to polyI:C at GD19, but not GD10. A subpopulation of these NeuN+ \{IWMNs\} was shown to express SST. PolyI:C treatment of dams induced a significant increase in the density of SST+ \{IWMNs\} in the offspring when delivered at both gestational stages with more regionally widespread effects observed at GD19. A positive correlation was observed between NeuN+ and SST+ \{IWMN\} density in animals exposed to polyI:C at GD19, but not controls. This is the first study to show that \{MIA\} increases \{IWMN\} density in adult offspring in a similar manner to that seen in the brain in schizophrenia. This suggests the \{MIA\} model will be useful in future studies aimed at probing the relationship between \{IWMNs\} and schizophrenia. "

Rapamycin, a specific and potent inhibitor of mTOR signaling, could regulate synaptic plasticity and synaptic transmission of glutamatergic neurons following prolonged treatment. Its immediate effects on electrophysiological properties of cortical layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons where the information undergoes a sophisticated processing remain unknown. Here, we found that acute (within 2 min) bath-application of rapamycin (0.5 μg ml−1) was able to depolarize the current-clamp baseline potentials significantly at postnatal day (P) 4, \{P10\} in rats and \{P90\} in mice (P &lt; 0.05), and altered the membrane current/voltage (I/V) curves in an age-dependent manner. Rapamycin not only increased the standard deviation or the peak amplitude of baseline membrane potential, but also increased the frequencies of spontaneous action potentials in more mature neurons (P10 and P90). In addition, rapamycin decreased the burst-firing frequencies of cortical \{L5\} burst-spiking neurons from mature brains, and further switched their firing modes to regular-spiking ones. These findings suggest that acute inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin induces an immediate impact on \{L5\} pyramidal neurons’ electrophysiological properties, indicating that its effects might involve mechanisms of ion channel’s regulation.

Because cortical excitatory neurons, including callosal projection neurons, migrate to the cortical plate during development, with the actin-binding proteins playing crucial roles during migration, we evaluated whether \{FILIP\} is involved in the development of the callosal projection neurons by histological analysis of Filip-knockout mice. The positioning of the callosal projection neurons, especially those expressing Plxnd1, in the superficial layer of the cortex is disturbed in these mice, which suggests that \{FILIP\} is a key molecule that links callosal projections to the pathogenesis of brain disorders.

The objective of present study is to investigate the effect of rotenone on developing \{VM\} neurons at immature versus mature stages. Primary \{VM\} neurons were cultured in the absence of glial cells. Exposure of \{VM\} neurons to rotenone for 2 days induced cell death in both immature and mature neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, but to a greater extent in mature neurons. While rotenone-treated mature \{VM\} neurons showed α-synuclein aggregation and sensitivity to \{DA\} neurons, immature \{VM\} neurons exhibited only \{DA\} neuronal sensitivity but not α-synuclein aggregation. In addition, on rotenone treatment, enhancement of caspase-3 activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were higher in mature \{VM\} neurons than in immature neurons. These results suggest that even though both mature and immature \{VM\} neurons are sensitive to rotenone, their manifestations differ from each other, with only mature \{VM\} neurons exhibiting Parkinsonian conditions.

abstract = "Abstract Cochlear implants (CI) have been used for several decades to treat patients with profound hearing loss. Nevertheless, results vary between individuals, and fine hearing is generally poor due to the lack of discrete neural stimulation from the individual receptor hair cells. A major problem is the deliverance of independent stimulation signals to individual auditory neurons. Fine hearing requires significantly more stimulation contacts with intimate neuron/electrode interphases from ordered axonal re-growth, something current \{CI\} technology cannot provide. Here, we demonstrate the potential application of micro-textured nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) surfaces on \{CI\} electrode arrays. Such textured \{NCD\} surfaces consist of micrometer-sized nail-head-shaped pillars (size 5 × 5 μm2) made with sequences of micro/nano-fabrication processes, including sputtering, photolithography and plasma etching. The results show that human and murine inner-ear ganglion neurites and, potentially, neural progenitor cells can attach to patterned \{NCD\} surfaces without an extracellular matrix coating. Microscopic methods revealed adhesion and neural growth, specifically along the nail-head-shaped \{NCD\} pillars in an ordered manner, rather than in non-textured areas. This pattern was established when the inter-NCD pillar distance varied between 4 and 9 μm. The findings demonstrate that regenerating auditory neurons show a strong affinity to the \{NCD\} pillars, and the technique could be used for neural guidance and the creation of new neural networks. Together with the NCD’s unique anti-bacterial and electrical properties, patterned \{NCD\} surfaces could provide designed neural/electrode interfaces to create independent electrical stimulation signals in \{CI\} electrode arrays for the neural population. Statement of Significance Cochlear implant is currently a successful way to treat sensorineural hearing loss and deafness especially in children. Although clinically successful, patients’ fine hearing cannot be completely restored. One problem is the amount of the electrodes; 12-20 electrodes are used to replace the function of 3400 inner hair cells. Intense research is ongoing aiming to increase the number of electrodes. This study demonstrates the use of nanocrystalline diamond as a potential nerve-electrode interface. Micrometer-sized nanocrystalline diamond pillars showed high affinity to regenerated human neurons, which grew into a pre-defined network based on the pillar design. Our findings are of particular interest since they can be applied on any silicon-based implant to increase electrode count and to achieve individual neuron stimulation patterns. "

Using intracellular recordings from rat L4/L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons that were classified in vivo as C-nociceptors or C-LTMs, according to their dorsal root \{CVs\} and their responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli, the present study provides the first electrophysiological evidence that C-LTMs exist in the glabrous skin of the rat’s hindpaw. Indeed 6.4% (5/78) of the total sample of lumbar C-fiber \{DRG\} neurons with receptive fields in the glabrous skin of the rat hindpaw were C-LTMs. The electrophysiological properties of this rare subpopulation of C-fiber neurons (mean \{CV\} = 0.48 ± 0.06 m/s) are distinct from those of C-fiber high threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMs). Indeed, their mean mechanical (1.7 ± 1.1 mN) and electrical (4.0 ± 0.4 V) thresholds was significantly different from that of C-HTMs. They also exhibited faster action potential and afterhyperpolarization kinetics than C-HTMs. The present study lends support to previous studies that have provided indirect evidence for the presence of C-LTMs in glabrous skin. If C-LTMs are present in human glabrous skin, they may, in this type of skin, represent a novel peripheral neuronal substrate for the pleasant/social touch sensation, and account for or contribute to touch hypersensitivity after injury.

Thus, in the present study, we investigated circRNA expression differences in HT22 cells with oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) versus normal controls. The results from circRNA microarrays revealed that 15 circRNAs were significantly altered in the OGD/R model (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group. Among them, 3 were significantly up-regulated, and the other 12 were down-regulated. Furthermore, the up-regulated expression of mmu-circRNA-015947 was verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that up-regulated expression of mmu-circRNA-015947 could interact with miRNAs (mmu-miR-188-3p, mmu-miR-329-5p, mmu-miR-3057-3p, mmu-miR-5098 and mmu-miR-683) and thereby enhance target gene expression. \{KEGG\} pathway analysis predicted that mmu-circRNA-015947 may participate in apoptosis-related, metabolism-related and immune-related pathways, which are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of IRI. This research suggests that the overlapping expression of mmu-circRNA-015947 might be involved in the process of cerebral \{IRI\} and presents a novel molecular target for clinical therapy. "

Unfortunately, very little is known on the effects of creatine supplementation during neuron differentiation, while in vitro studies revealed an influence on neuron excitability, leaving the possibility of creatine supplementation during the \{CNS\} development an open question. Using a multiple approach, we studied the hippocampal neuron morphological and functional development in neonatal rats born by dams supplemented with 1% creatine in drinking water during pregnancy. \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons of supplemented newborn rats showed enhanced dendritic tree development, increased \{LTP\} maintenance, larger evoked-synaptic responses, and higher intrinsic excitability in comparison to controls. Moreover, a faster repolarizing phase of action potential with the appearance of a hyperpolarization were recorded in neurons of the creatine-treated group. Consistently, \{CA1\} neurons of creatine exposed pups exhibited a higher maximum firing frequency than controls. In summary, we found that creatine supplementation during pregnancy positively affects morphological and electrophysiological development of \{CA1\} neurons in offspring rats, increasing neuronal excitability.

They present a typical morphology, with a single dendrite that projects into the cavity and ends in the \{CSF\} with a protuberance. These anatomical features have led to the suggestion that CSF-cNs might have sensory functions, either by sensing \{CSF\} movement or composition, but the physiological mechanisms for any such role are unknown. This hypothesis was recently supported by the demonstration that in several vertebrate species medullo-spinal CSF-cNs selectively express Polycystic Kidney Disease 2-Like 1 proteins (PKD2L1). \{PKD2L1\} are members of the ‘transient receptor potential (TRP)’ superfamily, form non-selective cationic channels of high conductance, are regulated by various stimuli including protons and are therefore suggested to act as sensory receptors. Using patch-clamp whole-cell recordings of CSF-cNs in brainstem slices obtained from wild type and mutant \{PKD2L1\} mice, we demonstrate that spontaneously active unitary currents in CSF-cNs are due to \{PKD2L1\} channels that are capable, with a single opening, of triggering action potentials. Thus \{PKD2L1\} might contribute to the setting of CSF-cN spiking activity. We also reveal that CSF-cNs have the capacity of discriminating between alkalinization and acidification following activation of specific conductances (PKD2L1 vs. ASIC) generating specific responses. Altogether, this study reinforces the idea that CSF-cNs represent sensory neurons intrinsic to the central nervous system and suggests a role for \{PKD2L1\} channels as spike generators. "

The results showed that celangulin I could activate the high voltage-gated calcium channel at the concentration of 150 μM. The peak currents were increased by 17% of the initial value at the end of the 10-min recording after treated with celangulin I. The rises of intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2 +]i) in neurons treated by celangulin I showed that the effects of celangulin I were concentration-dependent. Activation of the RyRs by ryanodine decreased the calcium release induced by celangulin I, indicating that celangulin I exerts effect on insect RyRs. Furthermore, we also provided evidence for the first time that celangulin I activates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) sensitive intracellular calcium release channels in the endoplasmic reticulum third instar larvae neurons of S. exigua.

Several studies clarified an involvement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the microglial activation. However, the origin of \{ATP\} together with the release mechanism is unclear. Recent in vitro study revealed that an \{ATP\} marker, quinacrine, in lysosomes was released from neurite terminal of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to extracellular space via lysosomal exocytosis. Here, we demonstrate a possibility that the lysosomal ingredient including \{ATP\} released from \{DRG\} neurons by lysosomal-exocytosis is an additional source of the glial activation in \{DH\} after nerve injury. After rat \{L5\} spinal nerve ligation (SNL), mRNA for transcription factor \{EB\} (TFEB), a transcription factor controlling lysosomal activation and exocytosis, was induced in the DRG. Simultaneously both lysosomal protein, LAMP1- and vesicular nuclear transporter (VNUT)-positive vesicles were increased in \{L5\} \{DRG\} neurons and ipsilateral DH. The quinacrine staining in \{DH\} was increased and co-localized with \{LAMP1\} immunoreactivity after nerve injury. In DH, LAMP1-positive vesicles were also co-localized with a peripheral nerve marker, Isolectin \{B4\} (IB4) lectin. Injection of the adenovirus encoding mCherry-LAMP1 into \{DRG\} showed that mCherry-positive lysosomes are transported to the central nerve terminal in DH. These findings suggest that activation of lysosome synthesis including \{ATP\} packaging in DRG, the central transportation of the lysosome, and subsequent its exocytosis from the central nerve terminal of \{DRG\} neurons in response to nerve injury could be a partial mechanism for activation of microglia in DH. This lysosome-mediated microglia activation mechanism may provide another clue to control nociception and pain. "

It was suggested that long-term depression and rebound potentiation might synergistically support motor learning. Here, we have examined induction conditions of long-term depression and rebound potentiation in cultured rat Purkinje neurons, and found that both of them were induced simultaneously by certain patterns of depolarization of a Purkinje neuron. Further, we found that long-term depression was induced by shorter depolarizing pulses causing a smaller intracellular Ca2+ increase than rebound potentiation. These results support an idea that long-term depression and rebound potentiation synergistically contribute to motor learning, and suggest that long-term depression may play a primary role in wider variety of motor learning paradigms than rebound potentiation.

Results Microglia can be polarized into different functional phenotypes. Expression of \{NDRG2\} and Nos2 were significantly increased by \{LPS\} treatment on \{N9\} cells, whereas treatment with IL-4 dramatically suppressed the expression of \{NDRG2\} and remarkably elevated expression of Arg-1. Besides, \{MVs\} shed from LPS-treated \{N9\} microglia significantly inhibited cell viability of \{N2A\} neurons and expression of syntaxin-1A, and \{NDRG2\} interference reversed the up-regulated miR-375 in LPS-treated \{N9\} microglia and \{MVs\} shed from LPS-treated \{N9\} cells.

Despite that many efforts had been made to characterize biomarkers in order to allow for biological testing for their diagnoses, these disorders are currently detected and classified only by clinical appraisal based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Olfactory neuroepithelium-derived neuronal precursors have been recently proposed as a model for biomarker characterization. Because of their peripheral localization, they are amenable to collection and suitable for being cultured and propagated in vitro. Olfactory neuroepithelial cells can be obtained by a non-invasive brush-exfoliation technique from neuropsychiatric patients and healthy subjects. Neuronal precursors isolated from these samples undergo in vitro the cytoskeletal reorganization inherent to the neurodevelopment process which has been described as one important feature in the etiology of both diseases. In this paper, we will review the current knowledge on microtubular organization in olfactory neurons of patients with \{SZ\} and with \{BD\} that may constitute specific cytoskeletal endophenotypes and their relation with alterations in L-type voltage-activated Ca2+ currents. Finally, the potential usefulness of neuronal precursors for pharmacological screening will be discussed. "

Development This article presents a review of \{ALS\} pathogenesis. To this end, we have reviewed published articles describing either \{ALS\} patients or \{ALS\} animal models and we discuss how the main cellular pathways (gene processing, protein metabolism, oxidative stress, axonal transport, relationship with neuronal microenvironment) may be involved in motor neurons degeneration. Conclusions \{ALS\} pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Recent studies suggest that although initial triggers may differ among patients, the final motor neurons degeneration mechanisms are similar in most patients once the disease is fully established. "

The striatum receives excitatory input from cortex and thalamus, and the role of the former has been well-studied in HD. Here, we report that mutated huntingtin alters function of thalamostriatal connections. We used a novel thalamostriatal (T-S) coculture and an established corticostriatal (C-S) coculture, generated from \{YAC128\} \{HD\} and \{WT\} (FVB/NJ background strain) mice, to investigate excitatory neurotransmission onto striatal SPN. \{SPN\} in T-S coculture from \{WT\} mice showed similar mini-excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and amplitude as in C-S coculture; however, both the frequency and amplitude were significantly reduced in \{YAC128\} T-S coculture. Further investigation in T-S coculture showed similar excitatory synapse density in \{WT\} and \{YAC128\} \{SPN\} dendrites by immunostaining, suggesting changes in total dendritic length or probability of release as possible explanations for mEPSC frequency changes. Synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) current was similar, but extrasynaptic current, associated with cell death signaling, was enhanced in \{YAC128\} \{SPN\} in T-S coculture. Employing optical stimulation of cortical versus thalamic afferents and recording from striatal \{SPN\} in brain slice, we found increased glutamate release probability and reduced AMPAR/NMDAR current ratios in thalamostriatal synapses, most prominently in YAC128. Enhanced extrasynaptic \{NMDAR\} current in \{YAC128\} \{SPN\} was apparent with both cortical and thalamic stimulation. We conclude that thalamic afferents to the striatum are affected early, prior to an overt \{HD\} phenotype; however, changes in \{NMDAR\} localization in \{SPN\} are independent of the source of glutamatergic input.

abstract = "Abstract The cerebellum, due to its regular internal connectivity and the limited number of neuronal types, has inspired a series of modeling efforts. These vary in complexity and aim, ranging from single-neuron to network and system control models. Initially, theoretical models provided remarkable predictions on how the cerebellum might operate in the context of the sensorimotor control system, though at the expense of oversimplifications in neuron and network representation. Recently, two main advances have occurred, promoted by the availability of new physiological knowledge and by informatics technology. First, detailed biophysically grounded models of neurons and synapses have been developed and are now reaching a high level of sophistication, allowing a careful analysis of single-neuron computation. Major advances have been made with granule cell, Golgi cell, unipolar brush cell, Purkinje cell, deep cerebellar nucleus, and inferior olivary cell models. Moreover, dynamic synaptic models and networks of local microcircuits have been constructed. Second, it has been possible to transform these models into real-time versions, which have subsequently been applied to robotic simulations. Notably, real-time spiking networks of the cerebellum have been endowed with plasticity rules and embedded into robotic control systems. Thus, it is now becoming possible to translate the biophysical properties of neurons and synapses into network functions and to observe how these are exploited in the context of simulated behaviors. These observations are providing new insights into how single-neuron and connectivity properties are exploited by the cerebellar network operating in a closed loop. "

Although Epacs activate numerous downstream signaling cascades, the intracellular signaling which mediates Epac-induced sensitization of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that selective activation of Epacs with 8-CPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM (8CPT-AM) increases the number of action potentials (APs) generated by a ramp of depolarizing current and augments the evoked release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from isolated rat sensory neurons. Internal perfusion of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons with GDP-βS, substituted for GTP, blocks the ability of 8CPT-AM to increase \{AP\} firing, demonstrating that Epac-induced sensitization is G-protein dependent. Treatment with 8CPT-AM activates the small G-proteins Rap1 and Ras in cultures of sensory neurons. Inhibition of Rap1, by internal perfusion of a Rap1-neutralizing antibody or through a reduction in the expression of the protein using shRNA does not alter the Epac-induced enhancement of \{AP\} generation or \{CGRP\} release, despite the fact that in most other cell types, Epacs act as Rap-GEFs. In contrast, inhibition of Ras through expression of a dominant negative Ras (DN-Ras) or through internal perfusion of a Ras-neutralizing antibody blocks the increase in \{AP\} firing and attenuates the increase in the evoked release of \{CGRP\} induced by Epac activation. Thus, in this subpopulation of nociceptive sensory neurons, it is the novel interplay between Epacs and Ras, rather than the canonical Epacs and Rap1 pathway, that is critical for mediating Epac-induced sensitization.

The aim of this study was to investigate the structure–activity relationship of sulfated hetero-polysaccharides (DF1) and sulfated galactofucan polysaccharides (DF2) on dopaminergic neuron in vivo and in vitro. Treatment with samples significantly ameliorated the depletion of both \{DA\} and TH-, Bcl-2- and Bax-positive neurons in MPTP-induced \{PD\} mice, \{DF1\} showed the highest activity. The in vitro results found that \{DF1\} and \{DF2\} could reverse the decreased mitochondrial activity and the increased \{LDL\} release induced by MPP+ (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.001) which provides further evidence that \{DF1\} and \{DF2\} also exerts a direct protection against the neuronal injury caused by MPP+. Furthermore, the administration of samples effectively decreased lipid peroxidation and increased the level/activities of GSH, GSH-PX, \{MDA\} and \{CAT\} in \{MPTP\} mice. Thus, the neuron protective effect may be mediated, in part, through antioxidant activity and the prevention of cell apoptosis. The chemical composition of DF1, \{DF2\} and \{DF\} differed markedly, the \{DF1\} fraction had the most complex chemical composition and showed the highest neuron protective activity. These results suggest that diverse monosaccharides and uronic acid might contribute to neuron protective activity. "

Previous data from our lab suggests indirect actions of estrogen through ERα in neighboring astroglia to protect dopamine neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) toxicity in mouse mesencephalic cultures. We further evaluate estrogen signaling in astrocytes and the mechanism of estrogen’s indirect neuroprotective effects on dopamine neurons. Primary mesencephalic cultures pre-treated with 17β-estradiol and the membrane impermeable estrogen, E2-BSA, were both neuroprotective against MPP+ -induced dopamine neuron toxicity, suggesting membrane-initiated neuroprotection. ERα was found in the plasma membrane of astrocyte cultures and colocalized with the lipid raft marker, flotillin-1. A 17β-estradiol time course revealed a significant increase in Akt, which was inhibited by the \{PI3\} kinase inhibitor, LY294004. Estrogen conditioned media collected from pure astrocyte cultures rescued glial deficient mesencephalic cultures from MPP+. This indirect estrogen-mediated neuroprotective effect in mesencephalic cultures was significantly reduced when \{PI3\} kinase signaling in astrocytes was blocked prior to collecting estrogen-conditioned media using the irreversible \{PI3\} kinase inhibitor, Wortmannin. Estrogen signaling via astrocytes is rapidly initiated at the membrane level and requires \{PI3\} kinase signaling in order to protect primary mesencephalic dopamine neurons from MPP+ neurotoxicity.

Defects in axonal transport have been identified as an early pathological feature in several disorders of the nervous system. The visualisation and quantitative analysis of axonal transport in vivo in rodent models of neurological disease is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and for the identification of novel therapeutics. New method Here, we describe a method for the in vivo imaging of axonal transport of signalling endosomes in the sciatic nerve of live, anaesthetised mice. Results This method allows the multiparametric, quantitative analysis of in vivo axonal transport in motor and sensory neurons of adult mice in control conditions and during disease progression. Comparison with existing methods Previous in vivo imaging of the axonal transport of signalling endosomes has been limited to studies in nerve explant preparations or non-invasive approaches using magnetic resonance imaging; techniques that are hampered by major drawbacks such as tissue damage and low temporal and spatial resolution. This new method allows live imaging of the axonal transport of single endosomes in the sciatic nerve in situ and a more sensitive analysis of axonal transport kinetics than previous approaches. Conclusions The method described in this paper allows an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of axonal transport in both motor and sensory neurons in vivo. It enables the detailed study of alterations in axonal transport in rodent models of neurological diseases and can be used to identify novel pharmacological modifiers of axonal transport. "

The role of calbindin in this differential vulnerability has been long elicited, and is seen in the \{MPTP\} induced mice models of PD. A peculiar feature of mice models is the strain specific differences in the susceptibility to MPTP. Here, calbindin-D28K expression in \{DA\} neurons of \{SNpc\} of \{MPTP\} susceptible C57BL/6 mice and \{MPTP\} resistant CD-1 mice was studied as a susceptibility marker of degeneration. Unbiased stereological estimation of immunoperoxidase stained midbrain sections revealed significantly higher number of calbindin immunoreactive cells in \{SNpc\} of CD-1 mice compared to that of C57BL/6 strain. Western blotting showed minimal differences in the levels. Calbindin–tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence co-labeling was performed to map the calbindin immunoreactive \{DA\} neurons in \{SNpc\} and ventral tegmental area (VTA) and to quantify the calbindin expression at cellular level. While the levels were comparable in \{VTA\} of both mice strains, the \{SNpc\} of CD-1 mice showed significantly higher calbindin expression. Within the SNpc, the medial and dorsal subdivisions showed higher calbindin expression in CD-1. The expression in the ventrolateral \{SNpc\} of both strains remained comparable. Our observations clearly point at overall higher levels and sizeable percentage of cells expressing more calbindin in \{SNpc\} of CD-1 mice, which might confer neuroprotection against MPTP, while its lower expression makes C57BL/6 mice more susceptible. Similar mechanism may be attributed to the phenomenon of differential prevalence of \{PD\} in different ethnic populations. "

The spiking neuron model used in this work is a simplified form of the well-known generalized Integrate-and-Fire neuron model, which can be trained using the Simplex method. The use of spiking neurons makes the system highly suitable for digital hardware implementations that exploit the inherent parallelism to replicate the intrinsic, computationally efficient, distributed control mechanism of CPGs. The system has been implemented on a Spartan 6 \{FPGA\} board and fully validated on a hexapod robot. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, based on existing models and techniques, for hexapod rhythmic locomotion. "

The spike delays in each synchronizing period represent the spectrum amplitudes. The encoding method was tested in two implementation examples: (a) encoding of human voice records for speech recognition propose; and (b) encoding of multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) records with the aim to detect interictal spikes in patients with epilepsy. Empirical evaluations confirm that encoded spike trains constitute a good representation of the continuous wavelet transform of the original signal, with the ability to capture interesting features from the input signal.

For the first time in mice, I reveal the presence, mainly in the SubLDT, of sleep-specific neurons displaying sustained tonic discharge either (i) just prior to, and during, paradoxical sleep (PS) (PS-on neurons) or (ii) during both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and \{PS\} (SWS/PS-on neurons). Both the PS-on and SWS/PS-on neurons showed either a low (&lt;10 Hz) or high (⩾10 Hz) rate of spontaneous firing and exhibited a biphasic narrow or medium-to-broad action potential, a characteristic of non-cholinergic neurons. At the transition from \{SWS\} to waking (W), the PS-on and SWS/PS-on neurons simultaneously ceased firing shortly before the onset of W, whereas, at the transition from W to SWS, only the SWS/PS-on neurons fired shortly after the onset of sleep. At the transition from \{SWS\} to PS, only the PS-on neurons exhibited a significant increase in discharge rate before \{PS\} onset, while, at the transition from \{PS\} to W, the SWS/PS-on neurons, then the PS-on neurons, displayed a significant decrease in the discharge rate before the end of PS. The SWS/PS-on neurons were more sensitive to the change in the electroencephalogram (EEG) than the PS-on neurons, as, during a \{PS\} episode, the slightest interruption of rhythmic theta activity resulted in cessation of discharge of the SWS/PS-on neurons. These findings support the view that, in the mouse SubLDT, PS-on neurons play an important role in the induction, maintenance, and cessation of PS, while SWS/PS-on neurons play a role in the maintenance of the \{PS\} state in particular and the sleep state in general.

Loss of one En1 allele in the mouse leads to progressive demise of mDA neurons in the ventral midbrain starting from 6 weeks of age. These mice also develop Parkinson disease-like motor and non-motor symptoms. The characterization of En1 heterozygous mice have revealed striking parallels to central mechanisms of Parkinson disease pathogenesis, mainly related to mitochondrial dysfunction and retrograde degeneration. Thanks to the ability of homeoproteins to transduce cells, En1/2 proteins have also been used to protect mDA neurons in various experimental models of Parkinson disease. This neuroprotection is partly linked to the ability of En1/2 to regulate the translation of certain nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs for complex I subunits. Other transcription factors that govern mDA neuron development (e.g. Foxa1/2, Lmx1a/b, Nurr1, Otx2, Pitx3) also continue to function for the survival and maintenance of mDA neurons in the adult and act through partially overlapping but also diverse mechanisms.

No significant changes in gene expression, as measured by RNA-Seq, or cytosine modification levels, as measured by the Illumina 450K arrays, were observed between batches relative to changes over time. As expected, neurotoxic chemotherapeutics affected neuronal outgrowth, but no inter-batch differences were observed in sensitivity to paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. As a testament to the utility of the model for studies of neuropathy, we observed that genes involved in neuropathy had relatively higher expression levels in these samples across different time points. Our results suggest that the process used to differentiate iPSCs into neurons is consistent, resulting in minimal intra-individual variability across batches. Therefore, this model is reasonable for studies of human neuropathy, druggable targets to prevent neuropathy, and other neurological diseases. "

The stimulatory effects of nicotine are direct, dependent on α7 and α4β2 somatodendritic nAChRs, and indirect, dependent on presynaptic nAChRs located on glutamatergic (α4β2 nAChRs) and noradrenergic (α7 nAChRs) terminals in the DRN.

abstract = "Abstract Afferent connections to the sensory inner (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea refine and functionally mature during the thyroid hormone (TH)-critical period of inner ear development that occurs perinatally in rodents. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypothyroidism on afferent type \{II\} innervation to outer hair cells using the Snell dwarf mouse (Pit1dw). Using a transgenic approach to specifically label type \{II\} spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), we found that lack of \{TH\} causes persistence of excess type \{II\} \{SGN\} connections to the OHCs, as well as continued expression of the hair cell functional marker, otoferlin (OTOF), in the \{OHCs\} beyond the maturation period. We also observed a concurrent delay in efferent attachment to the OHCs. Supplementing with \{TH\} during the early postnatal period from postnatal day (P) 3 to \{P4\} reversed the defect in type \{II\} \{SGN\} pruning but did not alter \{OTOF\} expression. Our results show that hypothyroidism causes a defect in the large-scale pruning of afferent type \{II\} \{SGNs\} in the cochlea, and a delay in efferent attachment and the maturation of \{OTOF\} expression. Our data suggest that the state of maturation of hair cells, as determined by \{OTOF\} expression, may not regulate the pruning of their afferent innervation. "

For some of these risk factors, independent prior investigations have examined the effects of genetic alterations on the cellular electrical excitability and calcium homeostasis. In the present proof-of-concept study, we harnessed these experimental results for modeling of computational properties on layer V cortical pyramidal cells and identified possible common alterations in behavior across SCZ-related genes. Methods We applied a biophysically detailed multicompartmental model to study the excitability of a layer V pyramidal cell. We reviewed the literature on functional genomics for variants of genes associated with \{SCZ\} and used changes in neuron model parameters to represent the effects of these variants. Results We present and apply a framework for examining the effects of subtle single nucleotide polymorphisms in ion channel and calcium transporter-encoding genes on neuron excitability. Our analysis indicates that most of the considered SCZ-related genetic variants affect the spiking behavior and intracellular calcium dynamics resulting from summation of inputs across the dendritic tree. ConclusionS Our results suggest that alteration in the ability of a single neuron to integrate the inputs and scale its excitability may constitute a fundamental mechanistic contributor to mental disease, alongside the previously proposed deficits in synaptic communication and network behavior.

Materials and methods Rats were randomly divided into five groups: Control, 6-OHDA only, Vehicle + 6-OHDA, zVAD + 6-OHDA, and \{V5\} + 6-OHDA, that rats were preadministrated with different reagents before 6-OHDA administration. Key findings The result showed that intrastriatal preadministration of Bip-V5 significantly decreased the amphetamine-induced rotation of the 6-OHDA model rats and the loss of the nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Moreover, Bip-V5 intrastriatal preadministration not only significantly decreased the expression of activated caspase 9 and activated caspase 3 but also decreased the enhanced expression of \{AIF\} and its nuclear translocation in the SNpc. The results in our study provide the first experimental evidence that both caspase-dependent and AIF-dependent apoptosis pathways are involved in the loss of the nigral \{DA\} neurons caused by intrastriatal administration of 6-OHDA, and intrastriatal preadministration of Bip-V5 can inhibit the above two apoptosis pathways to protect the nigral \{DA\} neurons.

Changes in neuronal tau protein are of interest, since tau becomes hyperphosphorylated in injury-resistant, hypothermic brains. Noting inter-species differences in tau isoforms, we have used functional cortical neurons differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hCNs) to interrogate tau modulation during hypothermic preconditioning at clinically-relevant temperatures. Key tau developmental transitions (phosphorylation status and splicing shift) are recapitulated during hCN differentiation and subsequently reversed by mild (32 °C) to moderate (28 °C) cooling — conditions which reduce oxidative and excitotoxic stress-mediated injury in hCNs. Blocking a major tau kinase decreases hCN tau phosphorylation and abrogates hypothermic neuroprotection, whilst inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A mimics cooling-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and protects normothermic hCNs from oxidative stress. These findings indicate a possible role for phospho-tau in hypothermic preconditioning, and suggest that cooling drives human tau towards an earlier ontogenic phenotype whilst increasing neuronal resilience to common neurotoxic insults. This work provides a critical step forward in understanding how we might exploit the neuroprotective benefits of cooling without cooling patients. "

Standard whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological techniques were used to characterize miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in recordings from the principal neurons (PNs) of the dentate gyrus, CA1, and \{CA3\} in acutely-obtained hippocampal slices from control and lithium/pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus(SE)-treated animals. The reduction in mIPSC amplitude was pervasive across the 3 regions examined in hippocampal slices obtained after 60 min (late) or just 15 min after the onset of SE. The mIPSC frequency was reduced in all 3 regions after 60 min and 2 regions (dentate, CA1) after 15 min. These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that a rapid modification of the postsynaptic \{GABAA\} receptor population leads to a widespread decline in GABA-mediated inhibition that, in part, contributes to both the self-sustaining nature of \{SE\} and to the decrease in the efficacy of benzodiazepines.

However, one of the most important issues for iDA-based applications is the degree to which iDA neurons resemble the molecular and functional properties of their endogenous \{DA\} neuron counterparts. Here we report that the homogeneity of the reprogramming gene expression system is critical for the generation of iDA neuron cultures that are highly similar to endogenous \{DA\} neurons. We employed an inducible system that carries iDA-inducing factors as defined transgenes for direct lineage reprogramming to iDA neurons. This system circumvents the need for viral transduction, enabling a more efficient and reproducible reprogramming process for the generation of genetically homogenous iDA neurons. We showed that this inducible system generates iDA neurons with high similarity to their bona fide in vivo counterparts in comparison to direct infection methods. Thus, our results suggest that homogenous expression of exogenous genes in direct lineage reprogramming is critical for the generation of high quality iDA neuron cultures, making such culture systems a valuable resource for iDA-based drug screening and, ultimately, potential therapeutic intervention in PD.

Eukaryotic cells utilize microtubules and two classes of microtubule-based motor proteins, cytoplasmic dynein and members of the kinesin family, to deliver a variety of membrane-bounded organelles and other cargos to their appropriate locations. In order to better understand the functions and regulation of cytoplasmic dynein, we developed a method to study its location and motility in living cells. The technique takes advantage of the long thin axons of cultured hippocampal neurons. We use calcium phosphate to transfect fluorescent-tagged dynein intermediate chain (IC) subunits (DYNC1I) into cultured neurons. When the \{ICs\} are expressed at low levels, they are effective probes for the location of the cytoplasmic dynein complex in axons when living cells are imaged with fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescent subunit probes can be used to identify specific cargos of dynein complexes with different \{IC\} isoforms as well as the kinetic properties of cytoplasmic dynein. "

To differentiate SH-SY5Y cells into neurons, \{RA\} (retinoic acid) is commonly used to produce the inductive effect. However, the percentage of neuronal cells produced from SH-SY5Y cells is low, either from the use of \{RA\} treatment alone or from the combined application of \{RA\} and other chemicals. In the current study, we used CM-hNSCs (conditioned medium of human neural stem cells) as the combinational inducer with \{RA\} to prompt neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. We found that neuronal differentiation was improved and that neurons were greatly increased in the differentiated SH-SY5Y cells using a combined treatment of CM-hNSCs and \{RA\} compared to \{RA\} treatment alone. The neuronal percentage was higher than 80% (about 88%) on the 3rd day and about 91% on the 7th day examined after a combined treatment with CM-hNSCs and RA. Cell maturation and neurite growth of these neuronal cells were also improved. In addition, the use of CM-hNSCs inhibited the apoptosis of RA-treated SH-SY5Y cells in culture. We are the first to report the use of CM-hNSCs in combination with \{RA\} to induce neuronal differentiation of RA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Our method can rapidly and effectively promote the neuronal production of SH-SY5Y cells in culture conditions. "

Here, we examined the excitatory and epileptogenic action of camphor in snail neurons and studied the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are involved to these effects. The spontaneous activities of neurons from subesophageal ganglia of snail Caucasotachea atrolabiata were recorded using single-electrode current clamp under control condition and after exposure to different concentrations of camphor and ion channel blockers. Under control condition, the studied neurons showed regularly spaced spontaneous action potentials. Exposure to low concentration of camphor (0.25 mM) reduced the duration of afterhyperpolarization and disrupted the spontaneous rhythmic activity, which was evidenced by an increase in the coefficient of variation of interspike intervals. The medium concentration of camphor (0.5 mM) induced more disruption in the precision of spontaneous action potential and increased the frequency of firing along with a reduction of action potential falling slope and afterhyperpolarization. Neurons showed paroxysmal depolarization shift and burst firing after exposure to camphor at high concentration (1.5 mM). We found that the blockade of K+ channels and upregulation of Ca2+ inward currents is essential for camphor-induced epileptiform activity, but the Na+ currents and ion channel phosphorylation with protein kinases A and C are not required. This work provided novel evidence at cellular and subcellular level that the modulation of ion channels, especially direct inhibition of K+ channels, is mechanistically involved to proconvulsive action of camphor.

Here we report a method for receptor labeling with a basic leucine zipper domain peptide (ZIP) and a binding cassette specific to ZIP. Receptors are tagged with a ZIP-binding cassette at their extracellular domain. Tagged receptors expressed in cultured cells were labeled with exogenously applied fluorescently labeled \{ZIP\} with low background and high affinity. To test if \{ZIP\} labeling is useful in monitoring endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, we next conjugated \{ZIP\} with a pH-sensitive dye RhP-M (ZIP-RhP-M). \{ZIP\} binding to its binding cassette was pH-resistant and RhP-M fluorescence dramatically increased in acidic environment. Thus AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) labeled by ZIP-RhP-M can report receptor endocytosis and subsequent intracellular trafficking. Application of ZIP-RhP-M to cultured hippocampal neurons expressing \{AMPARs\} tagged with a ZIP-binding cassette resulted in appearance of fluorescent puncta in PSD-95-positive large spines, suggesting local endocytosis and acidification of \{AMPARs\} in individual mature spines. This spine pool of \{AMPARs\} in acidic environment was distinct from the early endosomes labeled by transferrin uptake. These results suggest that receptor labeling by ZIP-RhP-M is a useful technique for monitoring endocytosis and intracellular trafficking.

Neurologic deficit was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Clinical outcome was assessed after 90 days according to the modified Rankin Scale. Results Neuron specific enolase levels correlated with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 24 h after rtPA bolus (R = 0.342, p = 0.005). Regarding the 67 included patients, 32 (47.8%) reached favorable outcome. They had a lower \{NIHSS\} score on admission (p = 0.000) and at 24 h after rtPA bolus (p = 0.000), and had lower levels of neuron specific enolase (p = 0.006).

In this scenario, increasing interest is growing on the critical role of glia cells, in particular astrocytes, in supporting the neuronal communication. Neuroglias communicate to each other through calcium signaling and are able to sense the activity of adjacent neurons and release gliotransmitter molecules such as glutamate and D-serine, which bind on receptors located on the synaptic terminal of neurons. In other terms, astrocytes can potentially modulate the neuronal activity of adjacent neurons as well as distant neurons through calcium signaling. In this paper, we describe the neuron–astrocyte communication paradigm, first identifying the molecular processes constituting the communication and then representing each process with equivalent electronic circuits, characterized by frequency response. The aim of this work is to propose an alternative tool for the stimulus–response analysis of the astrocyte–neuron system, in particular to quantify the impact of astrocytic stimulation on the natural activity of spiking neurons. The frequency response of the equivalent circuits shows that certain stimulation patterns evoked through the astrocytes are more effective than others and have the potential of significantly alter the neuronal activity.

This included the general transcription factor TFII-I for which we provide a first functional analysis in neurons. TFII-I modulated neuronal \{SRF\} target gene expression, enhanced nerve fiber growth and modulated the shape of neuronal growth cones. Interestingly, TFII-I modulated two \{SRF\} cofactors, Elk-1 and MRTF-A, in opposite directions. TFII-I and Elk-1 co-expression enhanced \{SRF\} target gene abundance, \{SRF\} promoter binding and neurite growth, whereas TFII-I and MRTF-A resulted in opposite outcomes.

abstract = "Abstract The recent discovery that mammalian nociceptors express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has raised the possibility that these cells directly detect and respond to pathogens with implications for either direct nociceptor activation or sensitization. A range of neuronal \{TLRs\} have been identified, however a detailed description regarding the distribution of expression of these receptors within sub-populations of sensory neurons is lacking. There is also some debate as to the composition of the \{TLR4\} receptor complex on sensory neurons. Here we use a range of techniques to quantify the expression of TLR4, \{TLR7\} and some associated molecules within neurochemically-identified sub-populations of trigeminal (TG) and dorsal root (DRG) ganglion sensory neurons. We also detail the pattern of expression and co-expression of two isoforms of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), a phospholipid remodeling enzyme previously shown to be involved in the lipopolysaccharide-dependent \{TLR4\} response in monocytes, within sensory ganglia. Immunohistochemistry shows that both \{TLR4\} and \{TLR7\} preferentially co-localize with transient receptor potential vallinoid 1 (TRPV1) and purinergic receptor \{P2X\} ligand-gated ion channel 3 (P2X3), markers of nociceptor populations, within both \{TG\} and DRG. A gene expression profile shows that \{TG\} sensory neurons express a range of TLR-associated molecules. \{LPCAT1\} is expressed by a proportion of both nociceptors and non-nociceptive neurons. \{LPCAT2\} immunostaining is absent from neuronal profiles within both \{TG\} and \{DRG\} and is confined to non-neuronal cell types under naïve conditions. Together, our results show that nociceptors express the molecular machinery required to directly respond to pathogenic challenge independently from the innate immune system. "

This method utilizes the introduction via nucleofection of a plasmid encoding a specific miRNA downstream of the L7/Pcp2 promoter, which drives PN-specific expression. As proof-of-principle, we used this plasmid to knock down the motor protein myosin Va, which is required for the targeting of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into \{PN\} spines. Consistent with effective knockdown, transfected \{PNs\} robustly phenocopied \{PNs\} from dilute-lethal (myosin Va-null) mice with regard to the \{ER\} targeting defect. Importantly, our plasmid-based approach is less challenging technically and more specific to \{PNs\} than several alternative methods (e.g., biolistic- and lentiviral-based introduction of siRNAs). We also present a number of improvements for generating mixed cerebellar cultures that shorten the procedure and improve the total yield of PNs, and of transfected PNs, considerably. Finally, we present a method to rescue cerebellar cultures that develop large cell aggregates, a common problem that otherwise precludes the further use of the culture. "

Rhes binding to mTORC1 is hypothesized to play a role in motor disorders such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Here, we investigate the behavioral and in vivo neurocircuitry changes associated with genetic deletion of Rhes or inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in the mouse model of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. 6-Hydroxydopamine-hemilesioned Rhes knockout mice and wild-type littermates were chronically treated with levodopa. In parallel, 6-hydroxydopamine-hemilesioned naïve mice were chronically treated with levodopa or levodopa plus rapamycin, to block mTORC1 pathway activation. Dyskinetic movements were monitored during levodopa treatment along with motor activity on the rotarod. Finally, dyskinetic mice underwent microdialysis probe implantation in the dopamine-depleted striatum and ipsilateral substantia nigra reticulata, and \{GABA\} and glutamate levels were monitored upon acute challenge with levodopa. Both Rhes knockouts and rapamycin-treated mice developed less dyskinesia than controls, although only rapamycin-treated mice fully preserved rotarod performance on levodopa. Levodopa elevated nigral \{GABA\} and glutamate in controls but not in Rhes knockouts or rapamycin-treated mice. Levodopa also stimulated striatal glutamate in controls and Rhes knockouts but not in rapamycin-treated mice. We conclude that both genetic deletion of Rhes and pharmacological blockade of mTORC1 significantly attenuate dyskinesia development by reducing the sensitization of striato-nigral medium-sized spiny neurons to levodopa. However, mTORC1 blockade seems to provide a more favorable behavioral outcome and a wider effect on neurochemical correlates of dyskinesia. "

Many other brain areas, particularly those controlling non-REMS (NREMS) and waking, modulate \{REMS\} by modulating these REMS-related neurons. Perifornical (PeF) orexin (Ox)-ergic neurons are reported to increase waking and reduce \{NREMS\} as well as REMS; dysfunction of the PeF neurons are related to \{REMS\} loss-associated disorders. Hence, we were interested in understanding the neural mechanism of PeF-induced \{REMS\} modulation. As a first step we have recently reported that PeF Ox-ergic neurons modulate \{REMS\} by influencing the \{LC\} neurons (site for REM-OFF neurons). Thereafter, in this in vivo study we have explored the role of PeF inputs on the \{PPT\} neurons (site for REM-ON neurons) for the regulation of REMS. Chronic male rats were surgically prepared with implanted bilateral cannulae in PeF and \{PPT\} and electrodes for recording sleep-waking patterns. After post-surgical recovery sleep-waking-REMS were recorded when bilateral PeF neurons were stimulated by glutamate and simultaneously bilateral \{PPT\} neurons were infused with either saline or orexin receptor1 (OX1R) antagonist. It was observed that PeF stimulation increased waking and decreased \{NREMS\} as well as REMS, which were prevented by \{OX1R\} antagonist into the PPT. We conclude that the PeF stimulation-induced reduction in \{REMS\} was likely to be due to inhibition of REM-ON neurons in the PPT. As waking and \{NREMS\} are inversely related, subject to confirmation, the reduction in \{NREMS\} could be due to increased waking or vice versa. Based on our findings from this and earlier studies we have proposed a model showing connections between PeF- and PPT-neurons for \{REMS\} regulation. "

A large amount of experimental evidences has shown that Syns are involved in the development of epileptic phenotypes and several mutations in Syn genes have been associated with epilepsy in humans and animal models. Syn mutations induce alterations in circuitry and neurotransmitter release, differentially affecting excitatory and inhibitory synapses, thus causing an excitation/inhibition imbalance in network excitability toward hyperexcitability that may be a determinant with regard to the development of epilepsy. Another approach to investigate epileptogenic mechanisms is to understand how silencing Syn affects the cellular behavior of single neurons and is associated with the hyperexcitable phenotypes observed in epilepsy. Here, we examined the functional effects of antisense-RNA inhibition of Syn expression on individually identified and isolated serotonergic cells of the Helix land snail. We found that Helix synapsin silencing increases cell excitability characterized by a slightly depolarized resting membrane potential, decreases the rheobase, reduces the threshold for action potential (AP) firing and increases the mean and instantaneous firing rates, with respect to control cells. The observed increase of Ca2+ and \{BK\} currents in Syn-silenced cells seems to be related to changes in the shape of the \{AP\} waveform. These currents sustain the faster spiking in Syn-deficient cells by increasing the after hyperpolarization and limiting the Na+ and Ca2+ channel inactivation during repetitive firing. This in turn speeds up the depolarization phase by reaching the \{AP\} threshold faster. Our results provide evidence that Syn silencing increases intrinsic cell excitability associated with increased Ca2+ and Ca2+-dependent \{BK\} currents in the absence of excitatory or inhibitory inputs.

However, it remains unclear whether dendritic processing for signal propagation and channel activation over dendrites is a function of the cell type-specific dendritic structure. By applying an extended analysis of signal attenuation for the physiological distributions of synaptic inputs and active channels on dendritic branches, we first demonstrate that regardless of their specific structure, all anatomically reconstructed models of primary neurons display a similar pattern of directional signal attenuation and locational channel activation over their dendrites. Then, using a novel modeling approach that allows direct comparison of the anatomically reconstructed primary neurons with their reduced models that exclusively retain anatomical dendritic signaling without being associated with structural specificity, we show that the reduced model can accurately predict dendritic excitability of the anatomical model in both passive and active mode. These results indicate that the directional signaling, locational excitability and their relationship are foundational features of dendritic processing that are independent of the cell type-specific structure across primary neurons.

In this study, we investigated whether \{BDNF\} exerts its neurotrophic effects through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in human embryonic spinal cord neurons in vitro. We found that neuronal growth (soma size and average neurite length) was increased by transfection with a \{BDNF\} overexpression plasmid. Western blotting and real-time quantitative \{PCR\} showed that expression of the \{BDNF\} pathway components TrkB, PI3K, Akt and PLC-γ was increased by \{BDNF\} overexpression. Furthermore, the Wnt signaling factors Wnt, Frizzled and Dsh and the downstream target β-catenin were upregulated, whereas GSK-3β was downregulated. In contrast, when \{BDNF\} signaling was downregulated with \{BDNF\} siRNA, the growth of neurons was decreased. Furthermore, \{BDNF\} signaling factors, Wnt pathway components and β-catenin were all downregulated, whereas GSK-3β was upregulated. This suggests that \{BDNF\} affects the growth of neurons in vitro through crosstalk with Wnt signaling, and that GSK-3β may be a critical factor linking these two pathways. To evaluate this possibility, we treated neurons with 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (BIO), a small molecule GSK-3β inhibitor. \{BIO\} reduced the effects of \{BDNF\} upregulation/downregulation on soma size and average neurite length, and suppressed the impact of \{BDNF\} modulation on the Wnt signaling pathway.

However, it has not been revealed whether neuronal activity under physiological condition modulates [Mg2+]i. The aim of this study is to explore the direct relationship between neural activity and [Mg2+]i dynamics. In rat primary-dissociated hippocampal neurons, the [Mg2+]i and [Ca2+]i dynamics were simultaneously visualized with a highly selective fluorescent Mg2+ probe, KMG-104, and a fluorescent Ca2+ probe, Fura Red, respectively. [Mg2+]i increase concomitant with neural activity by direct current stimulation was observed in neurons plated on an indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode, which enables fluorescent imaging during neural stimulation. The neural activity-dependent [Mg2+]i increase was also detected in neurons whose excitability was enhanced by the treatment of a voltage-gated K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium (TEA) at the timings of spontaneous Ca2+ increase. Furthermore, the [Mg2+]i increase was abolished in Mg2+-free extracellular medium, indicating [Mg2+]i increase is due to Mg2+ influx induced by neural activity. The direct neuronal depolarization by veratridine, a Na+ channel opener, induced [Mg2+]i increase, and this [Mg2+]i increase was suppressed by the pretreatment of a non-specific Mg2+ channel inhibitor, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). Overall, activity-dependent [Mg2+]i increase results from Mg2+ influx through 2-APB-sensitive channels in rat hippocampal neurons. "

The \{D2\} antagonist, haloperidol (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg, PO) produced an identical, regional pattern of c-Fos induction favoring the dorsolateral striatum of the rat. In contrast, the \{D1\} agonist, \{SKF82958\} (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg, PO), induced greater expression of c-Fos in the dorsomedial striatum.

In the Drd1a-tdTomato mice, MP-10 (3 or 10 mg/kg, IP) increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in both types of neurons, the induction was greater in the D1-negative neurons. Taken together, both the regional pattern of c-Fos induction in the striatal sub-regions and the greater induction of c-Fos in the D1-negative neurons indicate that \{PDE10A\} inhibition produces a small but significantly greater activation of the D2-containing striatopallidal pathway.

It was reported that chemicals in the nasal cavity directly reach the brain through the connection between olfactory neurons and the olfactory bulb (OB). In this ‘olfactory transport,’ xenobiotics absorbed at the nasal mucosa reach the brain by bypassing some physical barriers and defenses, and thus olfactory transport is suspected to be a vulnerable mechanism of the brain against invasion threats of environmental chemicals. In this study, we focused on the neuronal toxicity of rotenone administered intranasally to mice. The results showed that the mice that were administered rotenone had attenuated olfactory functions. We also found that intranasally administered rotenone induced acute mitochondrial stress at the OB. The repeated administration of rotenone resulted in a decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons, which are inhibitory interneurons in the OB. Taken together, our findings suggest that the inhalation of environmental toxins induces the neurodegeneration of cranial neurons through olfactory transport, and that olfactory dysfunction may be induced as an earliest symptom of neurodegeneration caused by inhaled neurotoxins.

As potential candidates we assessed thioredoxin-fold proteins, called redoxins, which maintain redox homeostasis by reduction of hydrogen peroxide or protein dithiol-disulfide exchange. Using a histologic approach, we show that the peroxiredoxins (Prdx1–6), the glutaredoxins (Glrx1, 2, 3 and 5), thioredoxin (Txn1 and 2) and their reductases (Txnrd1 and 2) are expressed in neurons, glial and/or vascular cells of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and in the spinal cord. They show distinct cellular and subcellular locations in agreement with the \{GO\} terms for “cellular component”. The expression and localization of Glrx, Txn and Txnrd proteins was not affected by sciatic nerve injury but peroxiredoxins were upregulated in the DRGs, Prdx1 and Prdx6 mainly in non-neuronal cells and Prdx4 and Prdx5 in \{DRG\} neurons, the latter associated with an increase of respective mRNAs and protein accumulation in peripheral and/or central fibers. The upregulation of Prdx4 and Prdx5 in \{DRG\} neurons was reduced in mice with a cre-loxP mediated deficiency of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) in these neurons.

abstract = "Abstract In this paper, a class of delayed Cohen–Grossberg neural networks without intra-neuron delay is investigated. Firstly, a modified delayed Cohen–Grossberg neural network is introduced, in which communication delays between different neurons are considered and the intra-neuron delays are negligible and ignored. Furthermore, by utilizing homeomorphism theory, matrix theory, Lyapunov functional method and some analysis techniques including classified discussion, reduction ad absurdum and component analysis, some new and less conservative criteria in terms of M-matrices are derived to ensure the existence, asymptotical stability and exponential stability of the equilibrium for the considered neural network. In our obtained results, the values of the self-connection strengths are reserved and play a central role, which improve and generalize some well-known corresponding results. Finally, some numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results. "

Age-related loss of tendon reflexes is a major contributing factor to this morbidity, and deterioration of the afferent limb of the stretch reflex is a potential contributing factor to such age-dependent loss of tendon reflexes. To evaluate this, we assessed the number and distribution of muscle spindle afferent fibers in human sacral spinal ganglia (S1) and tibial nerve samples obtained at autopsy, using immunohistochemical staining for the α3 isoform of Na+, K+-ATPase (α3NKA), a marker of muscle spindle afferents. Across all age groups, an average of 26 ± 4% of myelinated fibers of tibial nerve and 17 ± 2% of ganglion neuronal profiles were α3NKA-positive (n = 8 per group). Subject age explained 85% of the variability in these counts. The relative frequency of α3NKA-labeled fibers/neurons starts to decline during the 5th decade of life, approaching half that of young adult values in 65-year-old subjects. At all ages, α3NKA-positive neurons were among the largest of spinal ganglia neurons. However, as compared to younger subjects, the population of α3NKA-positive neurons from advanced-age subjects showed diminished numbers of large (both moderately and strongly labeled), and medium-sized (strongly labeled) profiles. Considering the critical significance of ion transport by \{NKA\} for neuronal activity, our data suggest that functional impairment and, also, most likely atrophy and/or degeneration of muscle spindle afferents, are mechanisms underlying loss of tendon reflexes with age. The larger and more strongly α3NKA-expressing spindle afferents appear to be proportionally more vulnerable. "

In this study, we used primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from neonatal rats to study the effects of chronic exposure to morphine on excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3) expression and the roles of µ opioid receptor (MOR), δ opioid receptor (DOR), and κ opioid receptor (KOR) in the morphine-dependent alterations in \{EAAT3\} expression. The results showed that the \{EAAT3\} protein and mRNA expression levels decreased significantly after chronic exposure to morphine (10 μmol/L) for 48 h, whereas the concentration of extracellular glutamate increased. In addition, we found that both the \{MOR\} inhibitor \{CTOP\} and the \{DOR\} inhibitor naltrindole could reverse the decreased expression of \{EAAT3\} after exposure to morphine, whereas the \{MOR\} activator \{DAMGO\} and the \{DOR\} activator \{DPDPE\} significantly decreased \{EAAT3\} expression. The \{KOR\} inhibitor had no effect on the expression of EAAT3, whereas its activator increased \{EAAT3\} expression. These results suggest that the down-regulation of morphine-dependent \{EAAT3\} expression in primary rat hippocampal cultures may be mediated by \{MOR\} and \{DOR\} and that \{KOR\} may not contribute significantly to this effect.

Genome wide deletion of Ptp1b, increases leptin sensitivity, protects mice from obesity and diabetes, but alters cardiovascular function by increasing blood pressure (BP). Leptin-control of metabolism is centrally mediated and involves proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Whether these neurons contribute to leptin-mediated increases in \{BP\} remain unclear. We hypothesized that increasing leptin signaling in \{POMC\} neurons with Ptp1b deletion will sensitize the cardiovascular system to leptin and enhance neurogenic control of BP. We analyzed the cardiovascular phenotype of Ptp1b+/+ and POMC-Ptp1b−/− mice, at baseline and after 7 days of leptin infusion or sympatho-activation with phenylephrine. \{POMCPtp1b\} deletion did not alter baseline cardiovascular hemodynamics (BP, heart rate) but reduced \{BP\} response to ganglionic blockade and plasma catecholamine levels that suggests a decreased neurogenic control of BP. In contrast, POMC-Ptp1b deletion increased vascular adrenergic reactivity and aortic α-adrenergic receptors expression. Chronic leptin treatment reduced vascular adrenergic reactivity and blunted diastolic and mean \{BP\} increases in POMC-Ptp1b−/− mice only. Similarly POMC-Ptp1b−/− mice exhibited a blunted increased in diastolic and mean \{BP\} accompanied by a gradual reduction in adrenergic reactivity in response to chronic vascular sympatho-activation with phenylephrine. Together these data rule out our hypothesis but suggest that deletion of Ptp1b in \{POMC\} neurons protects from leptin- and sympatho-mediated increases in BP. Vascular adrenergic desensitization appears as a protective mechanism against hypertension, and POMC-Ptp1b as a key therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunctions associated with obesity.

With an emphasis on Parkinson's disease, this chapter will discuss recent evidence supporting the assertion that vitamin D can be a useful therapeutic agent used as an intervention therapy to be combined with existing treatments; and the case for further development of novel treatments utilizing the potential of vitamin D. In addition, we present novel, previously unpublished evidence showing that in a unilateral model of Parkinson's disease, vitamin D can not only reduce the extent of denervation, but that this is also reflected in functional benefit to the animals. The potential of vitamin D is slowly being realized; in the future, it will be widely associated with far more than just bone health and may even contribute to an elusive treatment of neurodegenerative illness.

Unfortunately, accuracy of results from neural circuits׳ mathematical models is often biased by the presence of uncertainties in underlying experimental data. Moreover, due to problems with uncertainties identification in a multidimensional parameters space, it is almost impossible to classify states of the neural cortex, which correspond to a particular set of the parameters. Here, we develop a complete methodology for determining uncertainties and the novel protocol for classifying all states in any neuroinformatic model. Further, we test this protocol on the mathematical, nonlinear model of such a microcircuit developed by Giugliano et al. (2008) and applied in the experimental data analysis of Huntington׳s disease. Up to now, the link between parameter domains in the mathematical model of Huntington׳s disease and the pathological states in cortical microcircuits has remained unclear. In this paper we precisely identify all the uncertainties, the most crucial input parameters and domains that drive the system into an unhealthy state. The scheme proposed here is general and can be easily applied to other mathematical models of biological phenomena. "

Population synchronization may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which can be obtained in experiments. The instantaneous population firing rate (IPFR) R ( t ) , which may be directly obtained from the raster plot of spikes, is often used as a realistic collective quantity describing population behaviors in both the computational and the experimental neuroscience. For the case of spiking neurons, realistic thermodynamic order parameter and statistical–mechanical spiking measure, based on R ( t ) , were introduced in our recent work to make practical characterization of spike synchronization. Here, we separate the slow bursting and the fast spiking timescales via frequency filtering, and extend the thermodynamic order parameter and the statistical–mechanical measure to the case of bursting neurons. Consequently, it is shown in explicit examples that both the order parameters and the statistical–mechanical measures may be effectively used to characterize the burst and spike synchronizations of bursting neurons.

Ang III, which is a C-terminal metabolite of Ang II, can also act on \{AT1\} receptors, but its role in spinal nociceptive transmission remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the role of Ang \{III\} on the spinal nociceptive system in comparison with that of Ang II. Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of Ang \{III\} into mice produced a nociceptive behavior, which was dose-dependently inhibited by the co-administration of the \{AT1\} receptor antagonist losartan and the p38 \{MAPK\} inhibitor SB203580, but not by the \{AT2\} receptor antagonist PD123319, MEK1/2 inhibitor \{U0126\} and \{JNK\} inhibitor SP600125. In addition, Ang \{III\} increased the phosphorylation of p38 \{MAPK\} in the dorsal lumbar spinal cord, which was inhibited by losartan. These effects were similar to those of observed with Ang II. The nociceptive behavior produced by Ang \{II\} or \{III\} was also attenuated by the administration of the astrocytic inhibitor l-α-aminoadipic acid, but not by the microglial inhibitor minocycline. Double immunohistochemical staining showed that spinal \{AT1\} receptors were expressed on neurons and astrocytes, and that i.t. administration of either Ang \{II\} or \{III\} phosphorylated p38 \{MAPK\} in both spinal astrocytes and neurons. These results indicate that Ang \{III\} produces nociceptive behavior similar to Ang II, and suggest that the phosphorylation of p38 \{MAPK\} mediated through \{AT1\} receptors on spinal astrocytes and neurons contributes to Ang II- and III-induced nociceptive behavior.

Although most cases are sporadic, approximately 10% of cases are familial and the identification of mutations in these kindred has greatly accelerated our understanding of disease mechanisms. To date, the causal genes in over 70% of these families have been identified. Recently, we reported a mutation (R199W) in the enzyme that degrades d-serine, d-amino acid oxidase (DAO) and co-segregates with disease in familial ALS. Moreover, d-serine and \{DAO\} are abundant in human spinal cord and severely depleted in ALS. Using cell culture models, we have defined the effects of R199W-DAO, and shown that it activates autophagy, leads to the formation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates and promotes apoptosis, all of which processes are attenuated by a d-serine/glycine site antagonist of the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). These findings suggest that the toxic effects of R199W-DAO are at least in part mediated via the \{NMDAR\} involving the d-serine/glycine site and that an excitotoxic mechanism may contribute to disease pathogenesis.

In the first set of experiments, different concentrations of taurine were applied on \{PHA\} neurons. Taurine-induced responses were concentration-dependent. Taurine-induced currents were action potential-independent and sensitive to strychnine, suggesting the involvement of glycine receptors. In addition, taurine activated not only α-homomeric, but also αβ-heteromeric glycine receptors in \{PHA\} neurons. Interestingly, a low concentration of taurine (0.5 mM) activated glycine receptors, whereas a higher concentration (3 mM) activated both glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors in \{PHA\} neurons.

Here, we investigated the relationship between \{CB\} in the \{BFCN\} and the process of tangle formation in \{AD\} using antibodies to tau epitopes that appear early, intermediate or late in the process of tangle formation. Very small percentages (0%–3.7%) of CB-positive \{BFCN\} contained pretangles and/or tangles, and very small percentages (0%–5%) of the total \{BFCN\} pretangles and/or tangles were in CB-immunoreactive neurons. The number of CB-positive \{BFCN\} which contained tau immunoreactivity was highest for the early epitope and lower for intermediate epitopes. A late appearing epitope was absent from CB-positive BFCN. Age-related loss of \{CB\} appears to coincide with tangle formation in the \{BFCN\} and is associated with the full range of tau pathology, including late appearing epitopes. "

We previously reported that \{ACTH\} 1–39 protected oligodendroglia (OL) and their progenitors (OPC) from a panel of excitotoxic and inflammation-related agents. Neurons are the most vulnerable cells in the CNS. They are terminally differentiated, and sensitive to inflammatory and excitotoxic insults. For potential therapeutic protection of gray matter, it is important to investigate the direct effects of \{ACTH\} on neurons. Cultures highly enriched in neurons were isolated from 2–3 day old rat brain. After 4–7 days in culture, the neurons were treated for 24 h with selected toxic agents with or without \{ACTH\} 1–39. \{ACTH\} 1–39 protected neurons from death induced by staurosporine, glutamate, NMDA, AMPA, kainate, quinolinic acid, reactive oxygen species and, to a modest extent, from rapidly released NO, but did not protect against kynurenic acid or slowly released nitric oxide.

A growing number of studies suggest that alteration in gene expression is an important step in the progression from acute to chronic pain states and epigenetic regulation has been proposed to drive this change in gene expression. In this review, we discuss recent evidence that the DNA-binding protein neuron-restrictive silencing factor/repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (NRSF/REST) is an important component in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain through its role as a transcriptional regulator for a select subset of genes that it normally represses during development.

Grounded on this conceptualization, some of us recently suggested that when exposed to the Rorschach inkblots, in order to see a human movement (e.g., “a person running”) in those ambiguous stimuli, the observer would need to experience a “feeling of movement” via embodied simulation. The current study used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to further test this hypothesis. Specifically, we investigated whether temporarily interfering with the activity of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG; a putative \{MNS\} area) using rTMS would decrease the propensity to see human movement (M) in the Rorschach inkblots. Thirty-six participants were exposed to the Rorschach stimuli twice, i.e., during a baseline (without rTMS) and soon after inhibitory rTMS. As for the rTMS condition, half of the sample was stimulated over the \{LIFG\} (experimental group) and the other half over the Vertex (control group). In line with our hypothesis, the application of rTMS over LIFG, but not over Vertex, yielded a statistically significant reduction in the attribution of M to the ambiguous stimuli, with large effect size. These findings may be interpreted as being consistent with the hypothesis that there is a link between the \{MNS\} and the “feeling of movement” people may experience, when observing ambiguous stimuli such as the Rorschach cards.

abstract = "Abstract Medical advancements have increased life expectancy but have consequently increased the incidence of age-related disease. Fasting or dietary restriction (DR) can help prevent these via anti-ageing effects; however, these effects in neurons are less well characterized. Here, a series of animal and human studies of the effects of \{DR\} on the structural and functional integrity of neurons and the underlying mechanisms are analyzed. \{DR\} improves the integrity of animal neurons via a wide range of possible mechanisms including changes in metabolism, oxidative damage, stress responses, growth factors, and gene expression. These mechanisms are extensively interlinked and point to an optimum range of calorie intake, above calorie deprivation and below burdensome calorie excess. Human studies also suggest that \{DR\} improves neuron integrity; however, due to ethical and methodological limitations, the most conclusive data on \{DR\} hinge upon on-going life-long monkey experiments. Rather than developing pharmacological mimetics of DR, our focus should be on educating the public about \{DR\} in order to minimize age-related disease. "

Compared with mammalian central neurons, the spike dynamics of invertebrate neurons remain relatively unknown. Thus, we examined the spike dynamics based on single spike-induced Ca2+ signals in the dendrites of cricket mechanosensory projection neurons, known as giant interneurons (GIs). The Ca2+ transients induced by a synaptically evoked single spike were larger than those induced by an antidromic spike, whereas subthreshold synaptic potentials caused no elevation of Ca2+. These results indicate that synaptic activity enhances the dendritic Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Stimulation of the presynaptic sensory afferents ipsilateral to the recording site evoked a dendritic spike with higher amplitude than contralateral stimulation, thereby suggesting that alteration of the spike waveform resulted in synaptic enhancement of the dendritic Ca2+ transients. The \{SIZ\} estimated from the spatial distribution of the difference in the Ca2+ amplitude was distributed throughout the right and left dendritic branches across the primary neurite connecting them in GIs.

Human genetic studies, as well as studies examining structural changes at the cellular level, have converged on glutamatergic synapse formation, function, and maintenance as common pathophysiologic substrates involved in both disorders. Synapses as basic functional units of the brain are continuously modified by experience throughout life, therefore they are particularly attractive candidates for targeted therapy. Until recently we lacked a system to evaluate dynamic changes that lead to synaptic abnormalities. With the development of techniques to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients, we are now able to study neuronal and synaptic development in cells from individual patients in the context of genetic changes conferring disease susceptibility. In this review, we discuss recent studies focusing on neural cells differentiated from \{SCZ\} and \{ASD\} patient iPSCs. These studies support a central role for glutamatergic synapse formation and function in both disorders and demonstrate that iPSC derived neurons offer a potential system for further evaluation of processes leading to synaptic dysregulation and for the design and screening of future therapies.

Materials and methods Sections were taken from olfactory bulbs of post-mortem tissue specimens of 13 humans, males and females, aged from 19 to 63 years (≤35 and ≥50 years), with no history of neurological disorders. The tissues were fixed, embedded, cut on a freezing microtome, and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) antibodies. The number of positive neurons was counted. Results TH- and AADC-positive cells were present in the glomerular layer. There was no significant difference between the numbers of TH- and AADC-positive cells, in males and females, and in young and elderly individuals. The quantitative analysis revealed that the number of TH- and AADC-positive neurons were significantly higher in males than in females (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the number of TH- and AADC-positive neurons in the olfactory bulbs of the elderly compared with young individuals (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Factors such as gender and age may affect the number of dopaminergic neurons, and there is a correlation between increased dopaminergic neurons and olfactory performance. Moreover, the increase in dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulb of the elderly may indicate the existence of rostral migratory stream in adult humans. "

These requirements undermine many of the advantages provided by in vitro cell culture approaches when compared with more complex in vivo techniques. New Method Here, we identified a reliable marker (MHCI) that allows for direct isolation of primary neurons from fetal human brain. We utilized a magnetic labeling and isolation technique to separate neurons from other neural cells. We established a defined condition, omitting the astroglial supports that could maintain the human neurons for varying amounts of time. Results We showed that the new method significantly improved the purity of human neurons in culture without the need for further chemical/mechanical enrichment. We demonstrated the suitability of these neurons for functional studies including Rho-kinase dependent regulation of neurite outgrowth and ensheathment in co-cultures with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from fetal human brain. Comparison with existing methods The accountability for neuron-only seeding and the controllable density allows for better neuronal maturation and better visualization of the different neuronal compartments. The higher purity culture constitutes an effective system to study and screen for compounds that impact neuron biology without potential confounding effects from glial crowding. Conclusions High purity human neurons generated using the improved method will enable enhanced reliability in the discovery and development of drugs with neuroregenerative and neuroprotective activity.

The mirror neuron system (MNS) is a brain network implicated in understanding of action and imitation. No previous study has focused on identifying and monitoring the function of the \{MNS\} during the perioperative period in brain lesions. The aim of this study was to describe the application of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol to identify the \{MNS\} in a patient with a lesion in the premotor region. Case Description A specific fMRI protocol to identify regions belonging to the \{MNS\} was performed on a 19-year-old female patient who presented a cavernous angioma in the premotor region. The patient showed signs of impairment when imitating simple and complex hand movements. The fMRI protocol was performed before and 3 months after the surgical procedure. The protocol consisted of observation and execution conditions of a simple intransitive finger movement (precision grasping). \{MNS\} regions were identified during the pre- and postsurgical fMRI trials. Such mirror areas were respected during the procedure. The activation of these regions improved notably after the procedure, with a correlation between recovery of the ability to imitate simple and complex hand movements and higher and better-defined \{MNS\} activity. Conclusion The use of an fMRI protocol with observation and execution conditions based on simple intransitive finger actions allows the easy identification and preservation of the MNS. Increased activity on postoperative fMRI may be associated with improvement in motor functions. "

Tetropium fuscum (Fabr.) is an invasive longhorned wood-boring beetle originating from Europe that has been established in Nova Scotia, Canada, since at least 1990. This study used single sensillum recordings (SSR) to determine the response of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the antennal sensilla of male and female T. fuscum to different kinds of olfactory cues, namely host volatiles, non-host volatiles, the aggregation pheromone of T. fuscum (fuscumol), and an aggregation pheromone emitted by other species of longhorn beetles (3-hydroxyhexan-2-one). Each compound had been previously shown to elicit antennal activity in T. fuscum using electroantennography or had been shown to elicit behavioral activity in T. fuscum or other cerambycids. There have been very few \{SSR\} studies done on cerambycids, and ours is the first to compare response profiles of pheromone components as well as host and non-host volatiles. Based on \{SSR\} studies with other insects, we predicted we would find \{ORNs\} that responded to the pheromone alone (pheromone-specialists), as well as \{ORNs\} that responded only to host or non-host volatiles, i.e., separation of olfactory cue perception at the \{ORN\} level. Also, because male T. fuscum emerge earlier than females and are the pheromone-emitting sex, we predicted that the number of pheromone-sensitive \{ORNs\} would be greater in females than males. We found 140 \{ORNs\} housed within 97 sensilla that responded to at least one of the 13 compounds. Fuscumol-specific \{ORNs\} made up 15% (21/140) of all recordings, but contrary to our prediction, an additional 22 \{ORNs\} (16%) responded to fuscumol plus at least one other compound; in total, fuscumol elicited a response from 43/140 (31%) of \{ORNs\} with fuscumol-specific \{ORNs\} accounting for half of these. Thus, our prediction that pheromone reception would be segregated on specialist \{ORNs\} was only partially supported. Our prediction that females would have more \{ORNs\} that responded to fuscumol than would males was also not supported, as there was no difference. The stressed-host volatile linalool elicited the most responses of any compound tested, 43% of all recordings. "

Although the \{SMN1\} homolog \{SMN2\} also produces some \{SMN\} protein, it does not fully compensate for the loss or dysfunction of SMN1. Salbutamol, a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist and well-known bronchodilator used in asthma patients, has recently been shown to ameliorate symptoms in \{SMA\} patients. However, the precise mechanism of salbutamol action is unclear. We treated \{SMA\} fibroblast cells lacking \{SMN1\} and HeLa cells with salbutamol and analyzed \{SMN2\} mRNA and \{SMN\} protein levels in \{SMA\} fibroblasts, and changes in \{SMN\} protein ubiquitination in HeLa cells. Salbutamol increased \{SMN\} protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in \{SMA\} fibroblast cells lacking SMN1, though no significant changes in \{SMN2\} mRNA levels were observed. Notably, the salbutamol-induced increase in \{SMN\} was blocked by a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor and deubiquitinase inhibitor, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation assay using HeLa cells showed that ubiquitinated \{SMN\} levels decreased in the presence of salbutamol, suggesting that salbutamol inhibited ubiquitination. The results of this study suggest that salbutamol may increase \{SMN\} protein levels in \{SMA\} by inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated \{SMN\} degradation via activating β2-adrenergic receptor-PKA pathways.

Full-text articles of all potentially relevant citations were obtained and assessed for eligibility by two authors. Outcome measures of interest at a motor behaviour level were any measures of imitation or motor imagery proficiency and, at a neurological level, were any measures of neural activity in \{MNS\} brain regions. Due to differences in outcome measures between studies and the variables reported, a narrative review was undertaken to synthesise findings from the studies. \{RESULTS\} Overall, 31 articles met the inclusion criteria. Children and adults with \{DCD\} display deficits imitating meaningful and novel gestures and demonstrate different response patterns to controls when undertaking complex motor imagery tasks. Children with \{DCD\} present reduced activation and connectivity of frontal, parietal, and temporal \{MNS\} regions. \{CONCLUSIONS\} Preliminary evidence indicates some deficit in the functioning of the \{MNS\} at a motor behaviour and neurological level. As no published neuroimaging studies have been designed specifically to explore \{MNS\} function, these results must be interpreted with caution. Further research to explore the \{MNS\} hypothesis in greater detail, particularly from a neuroimaging perspective, has the potential to provide information on the underlying mechanisms of DCD, inform future research into the aetiology of this disorder, and inform intervention approaches.

We hypothesized that the bulbospinal neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are stimulated by uremic toxins in patients with chronic renal failure. To investigate whether \{RVLM\} neurons are sensitive to uremic toxins, such as uric acid, indoxyl sulfate, or methylguanidine, we examined changes in the membrane potentials (MPs) of bulbospinal \{RVLM\} neurons of Wister rats using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique during superfusion with these toxins. A brainstem-spinal cord preparation that preserved the sympathetic nervous system was used for the experiments. During uric acid, indoxyl sulfate, or methylguanidine superfusion, almost all the \{RVLM\} neurons were depolarized. To examine the transporters for these toxins on \{RVLM\} neurons, histological examinations were performed. The uric acid-, indoxyl sulfate-, and methylguanidine-depolarized \{RVLM\} neurons showed the presence of urate transporter 1 (URAT 1), organic anion transporter (OAT)1 or OAT3, and organic cation transporter (OCT)3, respectively. Furthermore, the toxin-induced activities of the \{RVLM\} neurons were suppressed by the addition of an anti-oxidation drug (VAS2870, an NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor), and a histological examination revealed the presence of NAD(P)H oxidase (nox)2 and nox4 in these \{RVLM\} neurons. The present results show that uric acid, indoxyl sulfate, and methylguanidine directly stimulate bulbospinal \{RVLM\} neurons via specific transporters on these neurons and by producing oxidative stress.

Cancer was not detected in the third patient who had circulating anti-Hu antibodies. A final diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndrome was made after investigations for alternative causes of lower motor neuron syndrome. Early diagnosis, combined treatment of the underlying cancer, and immunomodulatory treatment led to neurological improvement of the disease in two out of the three cases in which the cancer was diagnosed. Cases of subacute \{LMNS\} with rapid progression may occur as an expression of a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. Identification of these syndromes is important, as the treatment of underlying malignancy along with immunomodulatory treatment may result in a favorable long-term outcome of these potentially fatal diseases.

Accumulated evidences have suggested that oxidative stress is closely associated with the dopaminergic neurodegeneration of \{PD\} that can be protected by antioxidants. Biochanin A that is an O-methylated isoflavone in chickpea is investigated to explore its protective mechanism on dopaminergic neurons of the unilateral lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected rat. The results showed that biochanin A significantly improved the animal model's behavioral symptoms, prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons and inhibited the deleterious microglia activation in the LPS-induced rats. Moreover, biochanin A inhibited nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) activation and malondialdehyde (MDA) production, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in the rat brain. These results suggested that biochanin A might be a natural candidate with protective properties on dopaminergic neurons against the PD. "

It is well established that the brain 5-HT system is under autoregulatory control by its principal transmitter 5-HT via its effects on activity and expression of 5-HT system-related proteins. To examine whether 5-HT itself also has a crucial role in the acquisition and maintenance of characteristic rhythmic firing of 5-HT neurons, we compared their intrinsic electrophysiological properties in mice lacking brain 5-HT, i.e. tryptophan hydroxylase-2 null mice (Tph2−/−) and their littermates, Tph2+/− and Tph2+/+, by using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a brainstem slice preparation and single unit recording in anesthetized animals. We report that the active properties of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons in vivo (firing rate magnitude and variability; the presence of spike doublets) and in vitro (firing in response to depolarizing current pulses; action potential shape) as well as the resting membrane potential remained essentially unchanged across Tph2 genotypes. However, there were subtle differences in subthreshold properties, most notably, an approximately 25% higher input conductance in Tph2−/− mice compared with Tph2+/− and Tph2+/+ littermates (p&lt;0.0001). This difference may at least in part be a consequence of slightly bigger size of the \{DRN\} 5-HT neurons in Tph2−/− mice (approximately 10%, p&lt;0.0001). Taken together, these findings show that 5-HT neurons acquire and maintain their signature firing properties independently of the presence of their principal neurotransmitter 5-HT, displaying an unexpected functional resilience to complete brain 5-HT deficiency.

Neurospheres are the most commonly used neuroprogenitors for neuronal differentiation, but they often clump in culture, which has always represented a challenge for neurodifferentiation. In this study, we report a novel method and defined culture conditions for generating sub-type or region-specific neurons from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells derived neurosphere without any genetic manipulation. Round and bright-edged neurospheres were generated in a supplemented knockout serum replacement medium (SKSRM) with 10% CO2, which doubled the expression of the NESTIN, \{PAX6\} and \{FOXG1\} genes compared with those cultured with 5% CO2. Furthermore, an additional step (AdSTEP) was introduced to fragment the neurospheres and facilitate the formation of a neuroepithelial-type monolayer that we termed the “neurosphederm”. The large neural tube-type rosette (NTTR) structure formed from the neurosphederm, and the \{NTTR\} expressed higher levels of the PAX6, \{SOX2\} and \{NESTIN\} genes compared with the neuroectoderm-derived neuroprogenitors. Different layers of cortical, pyramidal, GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic neurons appeared within 27 days using the neurosphederm, which is a shorter period than in traditional neurodifferentiation-protocols (42–60 days). With additional supplements and timeline dopaminergic and Purkinje neurons were also generated in culture too. Furthermore, our in vivo results indicated that the fragmented neurospheres facilitated significantly better neurogenesis in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse brains compared with the non-fragmented neurospheres. Therefore, this neurosphere-based neurodifferentiation protocol is a valuable tool for studies of neurodifferentiation, neuronal transplantation and high throughput screening assays. "

Non-human primates have long been considered to be the most appropriate animal to model lower limb dysfunction. More recently, however, there has been a wealth of scientific information gathered in the rat regarding the central control of locomotion. Moreover, rodent models of \{SCI\} at lumbar levels have been widely used to validate therapeutic scenarios aimed at the restoration of locomotor activities. Despite the growing use of the rat as a model of locomotor dysfunction, knowledge regarding the anatomical relationship between spinal cord motor neurons and the hindlimb muscles that they innervate is incomplete. Previous studies performed in our laboratory have shown the details of the muscle/motor neuron topographical relationship for the mouse forelimb and hindlimb as well as for the rat forelimb. The present analysis aims to characterize the segmental distribution of the motor neuron pools that innervate the muscles of the rat hindlimb, hence completing this series of studies. The location of the motor end plate (MEP) regions on the main muscles of the rat hindlimb was first revealed with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. For each muscle under scrutiny, injections of Fluoro-Gold were then performed along the length of the \{MEP\} region. Targeting the \{MEPs\} gave rise to columns of motor neurons that span more spinal cord segments than previously reported.

The study consisted of control (CN-G), sham exposed (SHM-EG) and \{EMF\} exposed (EMF-EG) groups with 6 rats in each. The EMF-EG rats were exposed to 900 \{MHz\} \{EMF\} (1 h/day for 30 days) in an \{EMF\} jar. The SHM-EG rats were placed in the \{EMF\} jar but not exposed to the \{EMF\} (1 h/day for 30 days). The CN-G rats were not placed into the exposure jar and were not exposed to the \{EMF\} during the study period. All animals were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, and their brains were removed for histopathological and stereological analysis. The number of pyramidal neurons in the cornu ammonis of the hippocampus was estimated on Cresyl violet stained sections of the brain using the optical dissector counting technique. Histopathological evaluations were also performed on these sections. Histopathological observation showed abundant cells with abnormal, black or dark blue cytoplasm and shrunken morphology among the normal pyramidal neurons. The largest lateral ventricles were observed in the EMF-EG sections compared to those from the other groups. Stereological analyses showed that the total number of pyramidal neurons in the cornu ammonis of the EMF-EG rats was significantly lower than those in the CN-G (p&lt;0.05) and the SHM-EG (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, our results suggest that pyramidal neuron loss and histopathological changes in the cornu ammonis of 8-week-old male rats may be due to the 900-MHz \{EMF\} exposure. "

Both corticotropin signaling and glutamate receptor plasticity, which differ between males and females, are known to play important roles in the neural regulation of blood pressure. However, the relationship between hypertension and glutamate plasticity in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-receptive neurons in brain cardiovascular regulatory areas, including the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), is not understood. In the present study, we used dual-label immuno-electron microscopy to analyze sex differences in slow-pressor angiotensin \{II\} (AngII) hypertension with respect to the subcellular distribution of the obligatory \{NMDA\} glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluN1) subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in the \{RVLM\} and PVN. Studies were conducted in mice expressing the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) under the control of the \{CRF\} type 1 receptor (CRF1) promoter (i.e., CRF1–EGFP reporter mice). By light microscopy, GluN1-immunoreactivity (ir) was found in CRF1–EGFP neurons of the \{RVLM\} and PVN. Moreover, in both regions tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was found in CRF1–EGFP neurons. In response to AngII, male mice showed an elevation in blood pressure that was associated with an increase in the proportion of GluN1 on presumably functional areas of the plasma membrane (PM) in CRF1–EGFP dendritic profiles in the RVLM. In female mice, AngII was neither associated with an increase in blood pressure nor an increase in \{PM\} GluN1 in the RVLM. Unlike the RVLM, AngII-mediated hypertension had no effect on GluN1 localization in CRF1–EGFP dendrites in the \{PVN\} of either male or female mice. These studies provide an anatomical mechanism for sex-differences in the convergent modulation of \{RVLM\} catecholaminergic neurons by \{CRF\} and glutamate. Moreover, these results suggest that sexual dimorphism in AngII-induced hypertension is reflected by \{NMDA\} receptor trafficking in presumptive sympathoexcitatory neurons in the RVLM. "

Rat cortical neurons were isolated and cultured in vitro under mild hypothermia (32 °C). Apoptosis was measured by annexin V and propidium iodide staining, visualized by flow cytometry.

We model the dendrites as a multi-compartment tree with passive dynamics. Owing to the simplicity of the system, we obtain the full analytical solution for the model which we use to derive a lower dimensional return map that captures the complete dynamics of the system. Using the map, we explore how biophysical properties and dendritic tree architecture affect firing dynamics. As was first reported in earlier work by one of the authors, we also find that the addition of the dendritic tree can induce bistability between periodic firing and quiescence. However, we go beyond their results by systematically examining how dendritic tree topology affects the appearance of this bistable behavior. We find that the structure of the dendritic tree can have significant quantitative effects on the bifurcation structure of the system, with branchier topologies tending to promote bistable behavior over unbranched chain topologies. We also show that this effect occurs even when the input conductance at the soma is held fixed, indicating that the topology of the dendritic tree is mainly responsible for this quantitative change in the bifurcation structure. Lastly, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to explore the effect of biophysical properties on the firing dynamics of a neuron with a more complex dendritic tree topology. "

Mitochondrial respiration, mass, membrane potential and morphology were determined using bioenergetic, flow cytometric and transmission electron microscopic analyses of synaptosomes isolated from discrete brain regions containing axon terminals of \{NSDA\} and \{TIDA\} neurons. Maximum and spare respiratory capacities, and mitochondrial mass were lower in synaptosomal mitochondria derived from the striatum (ST) as compared with the MBH, which correlated with lower numbers of mitochondria per synaptosome in these brain regions. In contrast, there was no regional difference in mitochondrial basal, maximum or spare respirations following inhibition of Complex I activity with rotenone. These results reveal that higher numbers of viable mitochondria are correlated with more extensive autophagic mitochondrial quality maintenance in \{TIDA\} neurons as compared with \{NSDA\} neurons.

The broad variations in spike threshold are robust to the acupuncture frequency. It is also shown that the spike threshold is very sensitive to the maximal rate of rise of the action potential upstroke, and there is an obviously inverse relation between them. Our study provides a new perspective on the analysis of acupuncture-evoked signals. The findings could help to interpret how the individual spike evoked by manual acupuncture is generated in \{WDR\} neurons, which may contribute to uncover how acupuncture signals are encoded in its afferent neural pathway.

Human motor neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) offer new perspectives for disease modeling and drug testing in ALS. In standard iPSc-derived cultures, however, the two major phenotypic alterations of ALS—degeneration of motor neuron cell bodies and axons—are often obscured by cell body clustering, extensive axon criss-crossing and presence of unwanted cell types. Here, we succeeded in isolating 100% pure and standardized human motor neurons by a novel \{FACS\} double selection based on a p75NTR surface epitope and an HB9::RFP lentivirus reporter. The p75NTR/HB9::RFP motor neurons survive and grow well without forming clusters or entangled axons, are electrically excitable, contain ALS-relevant motor neuron subtypes and form functional connections with co-cultured myotubes. Importantly, they undergo rapid and massive cell death and axon degeneration in response to mutant \{SOD1\} astrocytes. These data demonstrate the potential of FACS-isolated human iPSc-derived motor neurons for improved disease modeling and drug testing in \{ALS\} and related motor neuron diseases. "

All except \{HA\} are modified by sulfation, giving \{GAG\} chains specific charged structures and binding properties. While significant neuroscience research has focused on the role of one \{PG\} family member, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), there is ample evidence in support of a role for the other \{PGs\} in regulating \{CNS\} function in normal and pathological conditions. This review discusses the role of all the identified \{PG\} family members (CS, HS, HEP, DS, \{KS\} and HA) in normal \{CNS\} function and in the context of pathology. Understanding the pleiotropic roles of these molecules in the \{CNS\} may open the door to novel therapeutic strategies for a number of neurological conditions. "

In this study, we combined a recent 3-dimensional imaging of solvent cleared organ (3DISCO) procedure, light-sheet microscopy, fluorescent retrograde tracer, and Imaris software to 3D map corneal sensory neurons within a whole adult mouse trigeminal ganglion (TG). We first established the optimized steps to easily and rapidly clear a fixed TG. We found that the 3DISCO procedure gave excellent results and took less than 3 h to clear the TG. In a second set of experiments, a retrograde tracer (cholera toxin B Alexa 594-conjugated) was applied to de-epithelialized cornea to retrograde-labeled corneal sensory neurons. Two days later, \{TGs\} were cleared by the 3DISCO method and serial imaging was performed using light-sheet ultramicroscopic technology. High-resolution images of labeled neurons can be easily and rapidly obtained from a 3D reconstructed whole mouse TG. We then provided a 3D reconstruction of corneal afferent neurons and analyzed their precise localization in the TG. Thus, we showed that neurons supplying corneal sensory innervation exhibit a highly specific limited dorsomedial localization within the TG. We report that our combined method offers the possibility to perform manual (on 20 μm sections) and automated (on 3D reconstructed TG) counting of labeled cells in a cleared mouse TG. To conclude, we illustrate that the combination of the 3DISCO clearing method with light-sheet microscopy, retrograde tracer, and automatic counting represents a rapid and reliable method to analyze a subpopulation of neurons within the peripheral and central nervous system.

In particular, the neural firing pattern is an important indicator of dynamic circuitry within a neuronal population. Indeed, in microcircuits, neurons act as soloists or choristers wherein the characteristical activity of a ‘soloist’ differs from the firing pattern of a ‘chorister’. Both cell types correlate their respective firing rate with the global populational activity in a unique way. In the present study, we sought to examine the relationship between the spike shape (thin spike neurons and broad spike neurons) of cortical neurons recorded from V1, their firing levels and their propensity to act as soloists or choristers. We found that thin spike neurons, which exhibited higher levels of firing, generally correlate their activity with the neuronal population (choristers). On the other hand, broad spike neurons showed lower levels of firing and demonstrated weak correlations with the assembly (soloists). A major consequence of the present study is: estimating the correlation of neural spike trains with their neighboring population is a predictive indicator of spike waveforms and firing level. Indeed, we found a continuum distribution of coupling strength ranging from weak correlation-strength (attributed to low-firing neurons) to high correlation-strength (attributed to high-firing neurons). The tendency to exhibit high- or low-firing is conducive to the spike shape of neurons. Our results offer new insights into visual processing by showing how high-firing rate neurons (mostly thin spike neurons) could modulate the neuronal responses within cell-assemblies. "

The model explains the online activity growth and the activity propagation patterns in relation to the interaction network, the endogenous and exogenous influence, and the individuals’ activation mechanism. Through simulation experiments and validation against empirical data from Twitter, we demonstrate that the model captures the relationship between the dynamically changing internal and external influence and the ensuing online activity. As such, it can accurately reproduce collective activity patterns arising from the online users’ response to various kinds of stimuli. The model can be generalized to handle a wide class of contagion phenomena. "

Glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) algorithm as a method for training the parameters of various kinds of neural network models gets easily into locally optimal traps during optimization process and its movement stability is also poor because of no memory about search history. To overcome the aforementioned disadvantages, firstly the linearly declining inertia weight is incorporated into the location update formula of standard \{GSO\} (LWGSO). After that in order to further enhance the robustness capability, differential evolution (DE) algorithm is introduced into \{LWGSO\} forming LWGSODE. Standard unimodal and multi-modal static test functions in high dimensions have been used to test its properties. The statistically experimental results show that the proposed \{LWGSODE\} approach performs much better than basic \{GSO\} whatever in terms of solutions precision, robustness or convergence speed. Moreover, the function optimization results are also competitive when compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the literature. Finally, the \{LWGSODE\} algorithm is used to train \{SMRN\} for time series prediction, and approximation results have improved significantly. All the results obtained reveal the novel \{SMRN\} model combined with the proposed \{LWGSODE\} algorithm provides a promising means to approximate nonlinear series in the future. "

This study aimed to explore the effects of nesfatin-1 on gastric distension (GD)-sensitive neurons in the basomedial amygdala (BMA) and the potential mechanism for nesfatin-1 to regulate gastric motility through the arcuate nucleus (Arc). The projection of nerve fiber and expression of nesfatin-1 were observed by retrograde tracing and fluo-immunohistochemistry staining. Single-unit discharges in the \{BMA\} were recorded extracellularly, and gastric motility in conscious rats was monitored. Results showed that the nesfatin-1/ fluorogold-double labeled neurons were observed in the Arc. Nesfatin-1 could excite the GD-excitatory neurons and inhibit the GD-inhibitory neurons in the BMA. Gastric motility and gastric emptying were significantly reduced by nesfatin-1 administration to the \{BMA\} in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of nesfatin-1 could be partially blocked by melanocortin 3/4 receptors antagonist, SHU9119. Electrical stimulation of the Arc significantly excited the response of \{GD\} neurons to nesfatin-1 and promoted gastric motility. Nevertheless, these effects could be mitigated by pretreatment with anti-NUCB2/nesfatin-1 antibody. It is suggested that nesfatin-1 in the \{BMA\} plays an important role in decreasing gastric motility and the Arc may be involved in this regulation process. "

The food relevant Hg species methylmercury (MeHg) has been frequently studied regarding its neurotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Neurotoxicity of thiomersal, which is used as a preservative in medical preparations, is to date less characterised. Due to dealkylation of organic Hg or oxidation of elemental Hg, inorganic Hg is present in the brain albeit these species are not able to readily cross the blood brain barrier. This study compared for the first time toxic effects of organic MeHg chloride (MeHgCl) and thiomersal as well as inorganic mercury chloride (HgCl2) in differentiated human neurons (LUHMES) and human astrocytes (CCF-STTG1). The three Hg species differ in their degree and mechanism of toxicity in those two types of brain cells. Generally, neurons are more susceptible to Hg species induced cytotoxicity as compared to astrocytes. This might be due to the massive cellular mercury uptake in the differentiated neurons. The organic compounds exerted stronger cytotoxic effects as compared to inorganic HgCl2. In contrast to HgCl2 exposure, organic Hg compounds seem to induce the apoptotic cascade in neurons following low-level exposure. No indicators for apoptosis were identified for both inorganic and organic mercury species in astrocytes. Our studies clearly demonstrate species-specific toxic mechanisms. A mixed exposure towards all Hg species in the brain can be assumed. Thus, prospectively coexposure studies as well as cocultures of neurons and astrocytes could provide additional information in the investigation of Hg induced neurotoxicity. "

While the gene was identified over two decades ago, it remains poorly understood why mutant \{HTT\} (mtHTT) is initially toxic to striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Models of \{HD\} using non-neuronal human patient cells and rodents exhibit some characteristic \{HD\} phenotypes. While these current models have contributed to the field, they are limited in disease manifestation and may vary in their response to treatments. As such, human \{HD\} patient \{MSNs\} for disease modeling could greatly expand the current understanding of \{HD\} and facilitate the search for a successful treatment. It is now possible to use pluripotent stem cells, which can generate any tissue type in the body, to study and potentially treat HD. This review covers disease modeling in vitro and, via chimeric animal generation, in vivo using human \{HD\} patient \{MSNs\} differentiated from embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. This includes an overview of the differentiation of pluripotent cells into MSNs, the established phenotypes found in cell-based models and transplantation studies using these cells. This review not only outlines the advancements in the rapidly progressing field of \{HD\} modeling using neurons derived from human pluripotent cells, but also it highlights several remaining controversial issues such as the ‘ideal’ series of pluripotent lines, the optimal cell types to use and the study of a primarily adult-onset disease in a developmental model.

To determine whether oxytocin excitation of medial \{NAcSh\} neurons is modulated by drugs that impact the brain reward pathway, we next tested the effects of \{ICV\} oxytocin following repeated morphine treatment. In morphine-treated rats, \{ICV\} oxytocin did not affect the mean firing rate of medial \{NAcSh\} neurons.

In addition, such networks are uniquely adaptable to neural systems unrestricted by rigid synaptic architecture (i.e. columns, layers or “patches”) which physically limits the number of possible task-specific interactions between neurons. Also hierarchical encoding is not random; it requires multiple exposures to the same types of relevant events to elevate synaptic connectivity between neurons for different stimulus features that occur in different task-dependent contexts.

The animals were decapitated 24 h after the 7th injection and samples of hypothalamus were prepared for light and electron microscopy, accompanied by morphometry to examine the histaminergic neurons. It was found that ethanol administration gradually decreased the duration of alcohol-induced sleep and decreased the total amount of histaminergic neurons and the amount of histologically normal neurons, but increased the amount of hypochromic neurons and shadow cells. The histaminergic neuron bodies and nuclei decreased in size. The ultrastructural changes in histaminergic neurons demonstrated activation of their nuclear apparatus, both destruction or hypertrophy and hyperplasia of organelles, especially lysosomes. The histochemical examination revealed the activation of lactate dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase, and inhibition of NADH−, NADPhH, and succinate dehydrogenases. Following 7 days of ethanol administration, histaminergic neurons exhibit the structural signs of hyperactivity, which can be related to neuronal adaptation to the actions of ethanol, and increased behavioral tolerance to ethanol.

In experiments with rodents, the irradiation with heavy ions induces a prolonged deficit in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. The exact nature of these violations remains mostly unclear. In this regard, the estimation of radiation effects at the level of single neurons is of our special interest. The present study demonstrates the results of comparative calculations that are performed to clarify the early physical events in single neurons under the exposure to accelerated 12C and 56Fe ions with different parameters. Using the Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations, the radiation effects are considered in terms of energy and dose deposition. The spatial patterns of energy and dose depositions within a single neural cell are produced. As additional characteristics, the spectra of the specific energy and energy imparted are estimated. Our results show that the cell morphology is an important factor determining the accumulation of radiation dose in neurons under the exposure to heavy ions. The data obtained suggest a possibility of radiation damage to synapses that are considered to play an important role in radiation-induced violations of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. "

Intracellular calcium was labeled by fluo-3/AM and examined using laser scanning confocal microscope and flow cytometry, and the apoptosis of neurons was also evaluated. Results: The intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis rates of mice neurons were significantly higher in Group-ApoE4 than in Group-ApoE3 and Group-WT after mechanical injury. However, without mechanical injury on neurons, no significant differences in intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis rates were found among all four experimental groups. The effects of ApoE4 on intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis rates of injured neurons were partly decreased by \{EGTA\} treatment. Conclusion: Compared with ApoE3-treatment and \{WT\} neurons, ApoE4 caused higher intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis rates of neurons after mechanical injury. This suggested \{APOE\} polymorphisms may affect neuron apoptosis after mechanical injury through different influences on intracellular calcium levels. "

Epidemiological studies revealed a male predominance of the disease that has been attributed to the female steroid hormones, mainly the estrogen. Estrogen neuroprotective effects have been shown in several studies, however the mechanisms responsible by these effects are still unclear. Previous data from our group revealed that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is crucial to the dopaminergic protection provided by 17β-estradiol, and also suggest that the intracellular estrogen receptors (ERs) are not required for that neuroprotective effects. The present study aimed to investigate the contribution of the G protein-coupled \{ER\} (GPER) activation in estrogen-mediated dopaminergic neuroprotection against an insult induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), and whether \{GPER\} neuroprotective effects involve the regulation of \{GDNF\} expression. Using primary mesencephalic cultures, we found that \{GPER\} activation protects dopaminergic neurons from MPP+ toxicity in an extent similar to the promoted by a 17β-estradiol. Moreover, \{GPER\} activation promotes an increase in \{GDNF\} levels. Both, \{GDNF\} antibody neutralization or \{RNA\} interference-mediated \{GDNF\} knockdown prevented the GPER-mediated dopaminergic protection verified in mesencephalic cultures challenged with MPP+. Overall, these results revealed that G1, a selective agonist of GPER, is able to protect dopaminergic neurons and that \{GDNF\} overexpression is a key feature to \{GPER\} induced the neuroprotective effects.

Odor-evoked responses of \{AL\} neurons and input-to-output transformations involved in pheromone processing are well characterized in this species. However, the intrinsic electrical properties responsible of the firing of \{AL\} neurons are poorly known. To this end, patch-clamp recordings in current- and voltage-clamp mode from neurons located in the two main clusters of cell bodies in the \{ALs\} were combined with intracellular staining on A. ipsilon males. Staining indicated that the lateral cluster (LC) is composed of 85% of local neurons (LNs) and 15% of projection neurons (PNs). The medial cluster (MC) contains only PNs. Action potentials were readily recorded from the soma in \{LNs\} and \{PNs\} located in the \{LC\} but not from \{PNs\} in the \{MC\} where recordings showed small or no action potentials. In the LC, the spontaneous activity of about 20% of the \{LNs\} presented irregular bursts while being more regular in PNs. We also identified a small population of \{LNs\} lacking voltage-gated Na+ currents and generating spikelets. We focused on the firing properties of \{LNs\} since in about 60% of LNs, but not in PNs, action potentials were followed by depolarizing afterpotentials (DAPs). These \{DAPs\} could generate a second action potential, so that the activity was composed of action potential doublets. \{DAPs\} depended on voltage, Ca2+-channels and possibly on Ca2+-activated non-specific cationic channels. During steady state current injection, \{DAPs\} occurred after each action potential and did not require high-frequency firing. The amplitude of \{DAPs\} increased when the interspike interval was small, typically within bursts, likely arising from a Ca2+ build up. \{DAPs\} were more often found in bursting than in non-bursting \{LNs\} but do not support bursting activity. \{DAPs\} and spike doublets also occurred during odor-evoked activity suggesting that they can mediate olfactory integration in the AL.

We used three forms of \{TMS\} stimulation (HF-rTMS, single and paired pulse) to investigate whether the mirror neuron system facilitates the motor system during goal-directed action observation relative to inanimate motion (motor resonance), a marker of putative mirror neuron activity. 31 healthy individuals were randomized to receive single-sessions of true or sham HF-rTMS delivered to the left inferior frontal gyrus – a component of the human mirror system. Motor resonance was assessed before and after HF-rTMS using three \{TMS\} cortical reactivity paradigms: (a) 120% of resting motor threshold (RMT), (b) stimulus intensity set to evoke motor evoked potential of 1-millivolt amplitude (SI1mV) and (c) a short latency paired pulse paradigm. Two-way \{RMANOVA\} showed a significant group (true versus sham) X occasion (pre- and post-HF-rTMS motor resonance) interaction effect for \{SI1mV\} [F(df) = 6.26 (1, 29), p = 0.018] and 120% \{RMT\} stimuli [F(df) = 7.01 (1, 29), p = 0.013] indicating greater enhancement of motor resonance in the true HF-rTMS group than the sham-group.

Tmt-DAT neurons located within \{TMN\} share electrophysiological properties with histaminergic neurons: spontaneous firing at a membrane potential around −50 mV and presence of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. Histamine (30 μM) depolarizes and excites Tmt-DAT neurons through \{H1R\} activation but inhibits histaminergic neurons through \{H3R\} activation thus allowing a pharmacological identification of the different neurons. Single-cell RT-PCR revealed that all histaminergic neurons expressing histidine decarboxylase (HDC) also express H3R. This includes neurons retrogradely traced from the striatum whose inhibition by a selective \{H3R\} agonist was indistinguishable from the whole population. Prolonged depolarization reduces the autoinhibition. The potency of histamine at \{H3R\} depends on membrane potential and on extracellular and intracellular calcium. Autoinhibition can be impaired by preincubation with capsaicin, a ligand of the calcium-permeable \{TRPV1\} channel or by blockade of Ca2+-ATPase with thapsigargin. The pharmacology of autoinhibition is revisited and physiological conditions for its functionality are determined. Usage of reporter mouse models for the safe identification of aminergic neurons under pathophysiological conditions is recommended. "

Commercially available human iPSC-derived neurons, when thoroughly characterized and suitable for viral transduction, might represent a faster model for drugs screening than the time-consuming derivation and differentiation of iPSC from patient samples. In this study we show that iCell® neurons are primarily immature \{GABAergic\} neurons within the tested time frame. Addition of \{C6\} glioma conditioned medium improved the bursting frequency of cells without further maturation or evidence for glutamatergic responses.

abstract = "Abstract It is well established that motor neurons are highly vulnerable to glutamate induced excitotoxicity. The selective vulnerability of these neurons has been attributed to \{AMPA\} receptor mediated excessive rise in cytosolic calcium and consequent mitochondrial Ca2+ loading. Earlier we have reported that in motor neurons a generic rise in [Ca2+]i does not always lead to mitochondrial Ca2+ loading and membrane depolarization but it occurs upon \{AMPA\} receptor activation. The mechanism of such specific mitochondrial involvement upon \{AMPA\} receptor activation is not known. The present study examines the mitochondrial Ca2+ regulation and oxidative stress in spinal cord neurons upon \{AMPA\} subtype of glutamate receptor activation. Stimulating the spinal neurons with \{AMPA\} exhibited a sharp rise in [Ca2+]m in both motor and other spinal neurons that was sustained up to the end of recording time of 30 min. The rise in [Ca2+]m was substantially higher in motor neurons than in other spinal neurons which could be due to the differential mitochondrial homeostasis in two types of neurons. To examine this possibility, we measured \{AMPA\} induced [Ca2+]m loading in the presence of mitochondrial inhibitors. In both cell types the \{AMPA\} induced [Ca2+]m loading was blocked by mitochondrial calcium uniporter blocker ruthenium red. In motor neurons it was also inhibited substantially by \{CGP37157\} and cyclosporine-A, the blockers of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) respectively, whereas no effect of these agents was observed in other spinal neurons. Thus in motor neurons the Ca2+ sequestration by mitochondria occurs through mitochondrial calcium uniporter as well as due to reversal of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, in contrast the latter pathway does not contribute in other spinal neurons. The \{ROS\} formation was inhibited by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME in both types of neurons, however the mitochondrial complex-I inhibitor rotenone suppressed the \{ROS\} formation only in motor neurons. It appears that activation of cytoplasmic nNOS leads to \{ROS\} formation in both types of spinal neurons but mitochondria is the major source of \{ROS\} in motor neurons. Spinal neurons exhibited a significant time dependent fall in glutathione (GSH) level. The \{GSH\} level in motor neurons did not recover even at 24 h after \{AMPA\} exposure, whereas the other spinal neurons exhibited a tendency to maintain the \{GSH\} after a certain level suggesting that the oxidative stress is arrested in other spinal neurons but it continues to increase in motor neurons. Thus our results demonstrate that upon \{AMPA\} receptor stimulation the motor neurons employ some additional pathways for regulation of mitochondrial calcium and oxidative stress as compared to other spinal neurons. It is suggested that such differential signaling mechanisms in motor neurons could be crucial for their selective vulnerability to excitotoxicity. "

Two “melastatin” \{TRP\} receptors, like \{TRPM8\} and \{TRPM3\} are also expressed in a subgroup of primary sensory neurons. These channels serve as thermosensors with unique thermal sensitivity ranges and are activated also by several exogenous and endogenous chemical ligands inducing conformational changes from various allosteric (“multisteric”) sites. We analysed the role of plasma membrane microdomains of lipid rafts on isolated trigeminal (TRG) neurons and TRPV1-expressing \{CHO\} cell line by measuring agonist-induced Ca2+ transients with ratiometric technique. Stimulation-evoked calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) release from sensory nerve endings of the isolated rat trachea by radioimmunoassay was also measured. Lipid rafts were disrupted by cleaving sphingomyelin (SM) with sphingomyelinase (SMase), cholesterol depletion with methyl β-cyclodextrin (MCD) and ganglioside breakdown with myriocin. It has been revealed that intracellular Ca2+ increase responses evoked by the \{TRPV1\} agonist capsaicin, the \{TRPA1\} agonsits allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and formaldehyde as well as the \{TRPM8\} activator icilin were inhibited after SMase, \{MCD\} and myriocin incubation but the response to the \{TRPM3\} agonist pregnenolon sulphate was not altered. Extracellular \{SMase\} treatment did not influence the thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+-release from intracellular stores. Besides the cell bodies, \{SMase\} also inhibited capsaicin- or AITC-evoked \{CGRP\} release from peripheral sensory nerve terminals, this provides the first evidence for the importance of lipid raft integrity in \{TRPV1\} and \{TRPA1\} gating on capsaicin-sensitive nerve terminals. \{SM\} metabolites, ceramide and sphingosine, did not influence \{TRPA1\} and \{TRPV1\} activation on \{TRG\} neurons, TRPV1-expressing \{CHO\} cell line, and nerve terminals.

However, the mechanisms through which it induces these effects are unknown. On the other hand, the cholinergic system, mainly basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, is involved in learning and memory regulation, and an alteration of cholinergic transmission or/and cholinergic cell loss could induce these effects. In this regard, it has been reported that \{CPF\} can affect cholinergic transmission, and alter \{AChE\} variants, which have been shown to be related with basal forebrain cholinergic neuronal loss. According to these data, we hypothesized that \{CPF\} could induce basal forebrain cholinergic neuronal loss through cholinergic transmission and \{AChE\} variants alteration. To prove this hypothesis, we evaluated in septal \{SN56\} basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, the \{CPF\} toxic effects after 24 h and 14 days exposure on neuronal viability and the cholinergic mechanisms related to it. This study shows that \{CPF\} impaired cholinergic transmission, induced \{AChE\} inhibition and, only after long-term exposure, increased \{CHT\} expression, which suggests that acetylcholine levels alteration could be mediated by these actions. Moreover, \{CPF\} induces, after acute and long-term exposure, cell death in cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and this effect is independent of \{AChE\} inhibition and acetylcholine alteration, but was mediated partially by \{AChE\} variants alteration. Our present results provide a new understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the harmful effects of \{CPF\} on neuronal function and viability, and the possible relevance of \{CPF\} in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

However, loss of complex I activity by systemic deletion of the Ndufs4 gene, one of the subunits comprising complex I, does not cause dopaminergic neuron death in culture. Here, we generated mice with conditional Ndufs4 knockout in dopaminergic neurons (Ndufs4 conditional knockout mice [cKO]) to examine the effect of complex I inhibition on dopaminergic neuron function and survival during aging and on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment in vivo. Ndufs4 cKO mice did not show enhanced dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta or dopamine-dependent motor deficits over the 24-month life span. These mice were just as susceptible to \{MPTP\} as control mice. However, compared with control mice, Ndufs4 cKO mice exhibited an age-dependent reduction of dopamine in the striatum and increased α-synuclein phosphorylation in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. We also used an inducible Ndufs4 knockout mouse strain (Ndufs4 inducible knockout) in which Ndufs4 is conditionally deleted in all cells in adult to examine the effect of adult onset, complex I inhibition on \{MPTP\} sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons. The Ndufs4 inducible knockout mice exhibited similar sensitivity to \{MPTP\} as control littermates. These data suggest that mitochondrial complex I inhibition in dopaminergic neurons does contribute to dopamine loss and the development of α-synuclein pathology. However, it is not sufficient to cause cell-autonomous dopaminergic neuron death during the normal life span of mice. Furthermore, mitochondrial complex I inhibition does not underlie \{MPTP\} toxicity in vivo in either cell autonomous or nonautonomous manner. These results provide strong evidence that inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity is not sufficient to cause dopaminergic neuron death during aging nor does it contribute to dopamine neuron toxicity in the \{MPTP\} model of Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest the existence of alternative mechanisms of dopaminergic neuron death independent of mitochondrial complex I inhibition. "

Intense activation of NF-κB p. 65 and p. 38 \{MAPK\} inflammatory signaling pathways was observed. Our findings indicate that neonatal exposure to \{CPF\} may induce long-term dopaminergic neuronal damage in the substantia nigra mediated by the activation of inflammatory response via NF-κB p. 65 and p. 38 \{MAPK\} pathways in the nigrostriatal system.

Aims of the study To investigate the neurotrophic effects of these ethnomedicines on the development of central nervous system neurons and the molecular bases of these activities. Materials and methods Rat embryonic (E19) brain neurons were cultured in the absence or presence of the ethanolic extract of Radix Puerariae (RPE) or puerarin. At predetermined times, cells were fixed and immunostained to visualize neuronal morphologies, or lysed for protein harvesting. Morphometric analyses of neurite outgrowths and synaptogenesis were performed using Image J software. \{RPE\} or puerarin-mediated changes in the protein profiles of cultured neurons were assessed by MALDI-TOF-MS/PMF and measuring immunofluorescent intensities. Results \{RPE\} and puerarin alone promoted maximum neurite outgrowths at concentrations of 1 µg/ml and 5 µM, respectively. At these optimal concentrations, \{RPE\} and puerarin provided neurotrophic support by promoting axo-dendritic arbors and synapse formation in cultured neurons. Proteomic study revealed that \{RPE\} and puerarin both up-regulated a number of proteins, including dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) and elongation factor 2 (EF2), which are associated with neuritogenesis and synaptic potentiation, respectively. Immunofluorescence intensity measurements confirmed the expressions of the \{DLC2\} and Dync1h1 subunits of dynein in \{RPE\} or puerarin treated hippocampal neurons were up-regulated when \{RPE\} or puerarin induced changes in neuronal cytoarchitecture. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that \{RPE\} and puerarin should be considered potentially valuable preventative therapeutics for brain disorders due to their abilities to promote the neuronal cytoarchitecture and the synaptic functionality, which are possibly associated with dynein-dependent regulation of cytoskeletal structures and up-regulation of translation machinery.

Eucalyptol (3 mM) depolarized the membrane potential and increased the frequency of spontaneous activity in a time dependent and reversible manner. These effects were associated with suppression of afterhyperpolarization and significant reduction of amplitude and slope of rising and falling phases of action potentials. While the eucalyptol-induced suppression of action potential amplitude and rising slope were essentially dependent on membrane depolarization, its actions on repolarization slope and afterhyperpolarization were not affected by resetting the membrane potential close to the control value. These findings suggest an inhibitory action on the potassium channels that underlie repolarization and afterhyperpolarization. Eucalyptol also increased the frequency of driven action potentials but suppressed the post stimulus inhibitory period, indicating an inhibitory action on calcium-activated potassium channels. A higher concentration of eucalyptol, 5 mM, reversibly changed the pattern of activity to burst firing associated with paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS). Low doses of eucalyptol and potassium channel blockers, tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine, synergistically acted to induce burst firing. At high concentration (30 mM), tetraethylammonium was able to induce burst firing and PDS. The sodium currents and ion channel phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C were not required for the eucalyptol-induced epileptiform activity, but calcium currents were essential for this action. Our findings show the excitatory and epileptogenic action of eucalyptol, which is most likely mediated through direct inhibitory action on potassium channels. "

One of the most common complications of early-onset diabetes mellitus is peripheral diabetic neuropathy, which is manifested either by loss of nociception or by allodynia and hyperalgesia. Dietary fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown the potential of anti-inflammation and modulating neuron excitability. The present study investigated the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the excitability of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes rats. The effects of \{DHA\} on the allodynia and hyperalgesia of diabetic rats were also evaluated. Dietary \{DHA\} supplementation effectively attenuated both allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by \{STZ\} injection. \{DHA\} supplementation decreased the excitability of \{DRG\} neurons by decreasing the sodium currents and increasing potassium currents, which may contribute to the effect of alleviating allodynia and hyperalgesia in diabetic rats. The results suggested that \{DHA\} might be useful as an adjuvant therapy for the prevention and treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. "

Methods In this study, aggregates of \{DA\} neuron precursors were enclosed in alginate–Ca2 + microbeads, and the encapsulated aggregates were cultured for 25 days to induce cell maturation. Results More than 60% of cells in the aggregates differentiated into tyrosine hydroxylase-positive \{DA\} neurons.

In addition, by exposure to a citrate solution, the alginate–Ca2 + gel layer could be easily removed from aggregates without damaging the \{DA\} neurons.

The mirror neuron system (MNS) serves as an important neuronal basis for social cognitive skills; however, previous investigations on the integrity of \{MNS\} function in schizophrenia remain approximate. Methods We employed a repetition suppression paradigm that allows for measuring neuronal responses to gesture observation and gesture execution. Cross-modal repetition suppression, i.e., adaptation between observe/execute and execute/observe conditions, was defined as the decisive experimental condition characterizing the unique sensori-motor properties of mirror neurons. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were assessed in 15 schizophrenia patients and 15 matched controls. Results We isolated an \{ERP\} signature of specific adaptation effects to identical hand gestures. Of critical importance, this \{ERP\} signature indicated intact intra-modal adaptive pattern, i.e., observe/observe and execute/execute, of comparable magnitude between groups, but deficient cross-modal adaptation, i.e., observe/execute and execute/observe, in schizophrenia patients. Conclusion Our data provide robust evidence that pure perception and execution of hand gestures are relatively intact in schizophrenia. In contrast, visuo-motor transformation processes mediated by the \{MNS\} seem to be specifically disturbed in schizophrenia. These results unambiguously demonstrate \{MNS\} deficits in schizophrenia and extend our understanding of the neuronal bases of social dysfunction in this disorder. "

The present study investigated the expression and function of \{P2Y12\} receptors in rat \{TG\} neurons. \{P2Y12\} receptor immunoreactivity was intense in the soma, dendrites, and axons, and colocalized with a pan-neuronal marker, neurofilament H, isolectin B4, and substance P. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, 2-methylthio-ADP (an agonist of P2Y1, 12, 13 receptors) transiently increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), an effect that was abolished by \{P2Y12\} receptor antagonists. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, ryanodine receptor/channel inhibitors diminished the 2-methylthio-ADP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. A sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor gradually increased [Ca2+]i, and after a plateau, application of 2-MeS-ADP induced a rapid and transient, but additive increase in [Ca2+]i. An adenylate cyclase inhibitor transiently increased [Ca2+]i, while a phosphodiesterase inhibitor prevented the 2-methylthio-ADP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Our study shows that \{P2Y12\} receptors are expressed in \{TG\} neurons, and act via a cAMP-dependent pathway to release intracellular Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores. "

Importantly, defects in \{GABAergic\} neuronal function and signaling have been linked to a number of neurological diseases, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. With patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models of neurological disease, it is now possible to investigate the disease mechanisms that underlie deficits in \{GABAergic\} function in affected human neurons. To that end, tools that enable the labeling and purification of viable \{GABAergic\} neurons from human pluripotent stem cells would be of great value. Results To address the need for tools that facilitate the identification and isolation of viable \{GABAergic\} neurons from the in vitro differentiation of iPSC lines, a cell type-specific promoter-driven fluorescent reporter construct was developed that utilizes the human vesicular \{GABA\} transporter (hVGAT) promoter to drive the expression of mCherry specifically in VGAT-expressing neurons. The transduction of iPSC-derived forebrain neuronal cultures with the hVGAT promoter-mCherry lentiviral reporter construct specifically labeled \{GABAergic\} neurons. Immunocytochemical analysis of hVGAT-mCherry expression cells showed significant co-labeling with the \{GABAergic\} neuronal markers for endogenous VGAT, GABA, and GAD67. Expression of mCherry from the \{VGAT\} promoter showed expression in several cortical interneuron subtypes to similar levels. In addition, an effective and reproducible protocol was developed to facilitate the fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS)-mediated purification of high yields of viable VGAT-positive cells. Conclusions These studies demonstrate the utility of the hVGAT-mCherry reporter construct as an effective tool for studying \{GABAergic\} neurons differentiated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells. This approach could provide a means of obtaining large quantities of viable \{GABAergic\} neurons derived from disease-specific hiPSCs that could be used for functional assays or high-throughput screening of small molecule libraries.

Here we examined the neuroprotective effects of \{GRd\} against neuronal insults induced by Aβ25–35 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. A 10 μM \{GRd\} treatment significantly prevented the loss of hippocampal neurons induced by Aβ25–35. In addition, \{GRd\} significantly ameliorated Aβ25–35-induced oxidative stress by decreasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); which is similar in treatments with 10 μM of probucol (PB) and 100 μM of edaravone (EDA). Moreover, our present study demonstrated that \{GRd\} significantly enhanced the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA, and decreased the expressions of Bax mRNA and Cyt c mRNA. \{GRd\} also downregulated the protein level of cleaved Caspase-3 compared to controls.

However, intracellular signaling molecules involved in regulating NPY/AgRP neuronal activity are incompletely understood. Since phosphodiesterase-3B (PDE3B) mediates the hypothalamic action of leptin and insulin on feeding, and is expressed in NPY/AgRP neurons, \{PDE3B\} could play a significant role in regulating NPY/AgRP neuronal activity. To investigate the direct regulation of NPY/AgRP neuronal activity by PDE3B, we examined the effects of gain-of-function or reduced function of \{PDE3B\} on NPY/AgRP gene expression in a clonal hypothalamic neuronal cell line, mHypoE-46, which endogenously express NPY, AgRP and PDE3B. Overexpression of \{PDE3B\} in mHypoE-46 cells with transfection of pcDNA-3.1-PDE3B expression plasmid significantly decreased \{NPY\} and AgRP mRNA levels and p-CREB levels as compared to the control plasmid. For the \{PDE3B\} knockdown study, mHypoE-46 cells transfected with lentiviral \{PDE3BshRNAmir\} plasmid or non-silencing lentiviral shRNAmir control plasmid were selected with puromycin, and stably transfected cells were grown in culture for 48 h. Results showed that \{PDE3BshRNAmir\} mediated knockdown of \{PDE3B\} mRNA and protein levels (∼60–70%) caused an increase in both \{NPY\} and AgRP gene expression and in p-CREB levels. Together, these results demonstrate a reciprocal change in \{NPY\} and AgRP gene expression following overexpression and knockdown of PDE3B, and suggest a significant role for \{PDE3B\} in the regulation of NPY/AgRP gene expression in mHypoE-46 hypothalamic neurons.

Cytosolic calcium overload and mitochondrial dysfunction are among the major mediators of high level glutamate-induced neuron death. Here, we show that the transient opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (tMPT) bridges cytosolic calcium signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction and mediates glutamate-induced neuron death. Incubation of the differentiated motor neuron-like \{NSC34D\} cells with glutamate (1 mM) acutely induces cytosolic calcium transient (30% increase). Glutamate also stimulates tMPT opening, as reflected by a 2-fold increase in the frequency of superoxide flash, a bursting superoxide production event in individual mitochondria coupled to tMPT opening. The glutamate-induced tMPT opening is attenuated by suppressing cytosolic calcium influx and abolished by inhibiting mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) with Ru360 (100 μM) or \{MCU\} shRNA. Further, increased cytosolic calcium is sufficient to induce tMPT in a mitochondrial calcium dependent manner. Finally, chronic glutamate incubation (24 h) persistently elevates the probability of tMPT opening, promotes oxidative stress and induces neuron death. Attenuating tMPT activity or inhibiting \{MCU\} protects \{NSC34D\} cells from glutamate-induced cell death. These results indicate that high level glutamate-induced neuron toxicity is mediated by tMPT, which connects increased cytosolic calcium signal to mitochondrial dysfunction. "

abstract = "AbstractBackground Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass electrodes possess the properties of optical transparency and high electrical conductivity, which enables the electrical stimulation of cultured cells to be performed whilst also measuring the responses with fluorescent imaging techniques. However, the quantitative relationship between the intensity of the stimulating current and the cell response is unclear when using conventional methods that employ a separated configuration of counter and stimulation electrodes. New method A quantitative electrical current stimulation device without the use of a counter electrode was fabricated. Results Nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiated \{PC12\} cells were cultured on an \{ITO\} single glass electrode, and the Ca2+ response to electrical stimuli was measured using fluorescent Ca2+ imaging. \{ITO\} electrode devices with a width less than 0.1 mm were found to evoke a Ca2+ response in the \{PC12\} cells. Subsequent variation in the length of the device in the range of 2–10 mm was found to have little influence on the efficiency of the electric stimulus. We found that the stimulation of the cells was dependent on the electrical current, when greater than 60 μA, rather than on the Joule heat, regardless of the width and length of the conductive area. Comparison with existing method(s) Because of the cells directly in contact with the electrode, our device enables to stimulate the cells specifically, comparing with previous devices with the counter electrode. Conclusions The \{ITO\} device without the use of a counter electrode is a useful tool for evaluating the quantitative neural excitability of cultured neurons. "

In this study, neurons and microglial cells were treated with ultrasounds (commonly used in diagnostics) and differences in cell proliferation and morphology were evaluated in comparison to control, untreated cells. Cell proliferation was evaluated by standard viability assessment, while the quantitative analysis of cell morphology, usually performed by edge and line detection algorithms, required the development of a new special algorithm. In fact, traditional software methodologies do not provide the appropriate tools for morphological analysis of neurons and microglial cells, typically characterized by a roughly triangular body and numerous elongations of different lengths resulting in a complex neuron–microglia network. This new method, based on a modified Hough Transform algorithm using a matching operator instead of the common gradient filter, enabled the automatic identification of cell elongations and branches, the extraction of related information, and the comparison of the data between control and treated neurons, as well as microglial cells. Results, based on the development of the new algorithm, showed that in ultrasound-treated cells, the number of elongations, as well as their maximum and mean lengths, increased significantly in comparison to control, untreated cells. These results were consistent with the standard microscopic evaluation. Furthermore, a significant correlation between cell morphology and proliferation suggested that ultrasounds induced cell differentiation affecting cell morphology, as well as the ability of neurons and microglial cells to form complex networks. Our results suggest the possibility of using ultrasounds, currently utilized in diagnostics, to reconstitute neuronal and microglial circuits that are often altered in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Cholinergic endings release acetylcholine, which activates nicotinic and/or G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors activate transduction systems, which control cellular effectors that regulate the membrane potential in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons. The mechanisms responsible for the cholinergic-dependent depolarization of mPFC layer V pyramidal neurons in slices obtained from young rats were elucidated in this study. Glutamatergic and \{GABAergic\} transmission as well as tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na+ and voltage-dependent Ca++ currents were eliminated. Cholinergic receptor stimulation by carbamoylcholine chloride (CCh; 100 μM) evoked depolarization (10.0 ± 1.3 mV), which was blocked by M1/M4 (pirenzepine dihydrochloride, 2 μM) and \{M1\} (VU 0255035, 5 μM) muscarinic receptor antagonists and was not affected by a nicotinic receptor antagonist (mecamylamine hydrochloride, 10 μM). CCh-dependent depolarization was attenuated by extra- (20 μM) or intracellular (50 μM) application of an inhibitor of the βγ-subunit-dependent transduction system (gallein). It was also inhibited by intracellular application of a βγ-subunit-binding peptide (GRK2i, 10 μM). mPFC pyramidal neurons express Nav1.9 channels. CCh-dependent depolarization was abolished in the presence of antibodies against Nav1.9 channels in the intracellular solution and augmented by the presence of ProTx-I toxin (100 nM) in the extracellular solution. CCh-induced depolarization was not affected by the following reagents: intracellular transduction system blockers, including U-73122 (10 μM), chelerythrine chloride (5 μM), \{SQ\} 22536 (100 μM) and H-89 (2 μM); channel blockers, including Ba++ ions (200 μM), apamin (100 nM), flufenamic acid (200 μM), 2-APB (200 μM), \{SKF\} 96365 (50 μM), and \{ZD\} 7288 (50 μM); and a Na+/Ca++ exchanger blocker, benzamil (20 μM). We conclude that muscarinic \{M1\} receptor-dependent depolarization in mPFC pyramidal neurons is evoked by the activation of Nav1.9 channels and that the signal transduction pathway involves G-protein βγ subunits.

In Grapholita molesta, ph-ORNs are highly sensitive and specific to the individual sex pheromone components, and thus help in the detection and discrimination of the unique conspecific pheromone blend. Plant odors interspersed with a sub-optimal pheromone dose are reported to increase male moth attraction. To determine if the behavioral synergism of pheromone and plant odors starts at the ph-ORN level, single sensillum recordings were performed on Z8-12:Ac and E8-12:Ac ph-ORNs (Z-ORNs and E-ORNs, respectively) stimulated with pheromone–plant volatile mixtures. First, biologically meaningful plant-volatile doses were determined by recording the response of plant-specific \{ORNs\} housed in sensilla auricillica and trichodea to several plant odorants. This exploration provided a first glance at plant \{ORNs\} in this species. Then, using these plant volatile doses, we found that the spontaneous activity of ph-ORNs was not affected by the stimulation with plant volatiles, but that a binary mixture of sex pheromone and plant odorants resulted in a small (about 15%), dose-independent, but statistically significant, reduction in the spike frequency of Z-ORNs with respect to stimulation with Z8-12:Ac alone. The response of E-ORNs to a combination of E8-12:Ac and plant volatiles was not different from E8-12:Ac alone. We argue that the small inhibition of Z-ORNs caused by physiologically realistic plant volatile doses is probably not fully responsible for the observed behavioral synergism of pheromone and plant odors.

This study investigated whether delayed administration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), at one week after neonatal rat hypoxia–ischemia, was neurorestorative of striatal medium-spiny projection neurons and improved motor function. The effect of a subcutaneous injection of a high-dose, or a low-dose, of \{MSCs\} was investigated in stereological studies. Postnatal day (PN) 7 pups were subjected to hypoxia–ischemia. At PN14, pups received treatment with either \{MSCs\} or diluent. A subset of high-dose pups, and their diluent control pups, were also injected intraperitoneally with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), every 24 h, on PN15, \{PN16\} and PN17. This permitted tracking of the migration and survival of neuroblasts originating from the subventricular zone into the adjacent injured striatum. Pups were euthanized on \{PN21\} and the absolute number of striatal medium-spiny projection neurons was measured after immunostaining for DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein-32), double immunostaining for BrdU and DARPP-32, and after cresyl violet staining alone. The absolute number of striatal immunostained calretinin interneurons was also measured. There was a statistically significant increase in the absolute number of DARPP-32-positive, BrdU/DARPP-32-positive, and cresyl violet-stained striatal medium-spiny projection neurons, and fewer striatal calretinin interneurons, in the high-dose mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) group compared to their diluent counterparts. A high-dose of \{MSCs\} restored the absolute number of these neurons to normal uninjured levels, when compared with previous stereological data on the absolute number of cresyl violet-stained striatal medium-spiny projection neurons in the normal uninjured brain. For the low-dose experiment, in which cresyl violet-stained striatal medium-spiny neurons alone were measured, there was a lower statistically significant increase in their absolute number in the \{MSC\} group compared to their diluent controls. Investigation of behavior in another cohort of animals showed that delayed administration of a high-dose of bone marrow-derived MSCs, at one week after neonatal rat hypoxia–ischemia, improved motor function on the cylinder test. Thus, delayed therapy with a high- or low-dose of adult MSCs, at one week after injury, is effective in restoring the loss of striatal medium-spiny projection neurons after neonatal rat hypoxia–ischemia and a high-dose of \{MSCs\} improved motor function.

Patients and methods The patients were aged 18, 40 and 52 years, respectively, at the onset of the disease and had a longstanding clinical course (more than 10 years for two patients and 8 years for one patient). They were followed up for more than 6 years. Results Clinical manifestations were characterized by (1) longstanding slow progression or delayed spontaneous arrest of asymmetric lower motor neuron signs localized exclusively in the upper extremities with unilateral predominance and distal or proximal preponderance; (2) the absence of upper motor neuron signs, bulbar signs, sensory disturbances and respiratory involvement; (3) a snake eyes appearance on the anterior horns of the cervical cord over more than 3 vertebrae by axial T2-weighted \{MRI\} and a longitudinal linear-shaped T2-signal hyperintensity by sagittal MRI; (4) neurogenic change with fasciculation and denervation potentials (fibrillation and a positive sharp wave) confined to the affected muscles by needle electromyogram; and (5) normal cerebrospinal fluid and a normal creatine kinase level. These cases did not fall into any existing category of LMND, such as progressive muscular atrophy, flail arm syndrome or Hirayama disease. Conclusions These patients should be classified as sporadic \{LMND\} with snake eyes on \{MRI\} with a relatively benign prognosis. "

The disorder is characterised by high iron levels in the brain, although the pathological mechanism leading to this accumulation is unknown. To address this question, we tested primary skin fibroblasts from three patients and three healthy subjects, as well as neurons induced by direct fibroblast reprogramming, for oxidative status, mitochondrial functionality and iron parameters. The patients' fibroblasts showed altered oxidative status, reduced antioxidant defence, and impaired cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitase activities compared to control cells. Mitochondrial iron homeostasis and functionality analysis of patient fibroblasts indicated increased labile iron pool content and reactive oxygen species development, altered mitochondrial shape, decreased membrane potential and reduced \{ATP\} levels. Furthermore, analysis of induced neurons, performed at a single cell level, confirmed some of the results obtained in fibroblasts, indicating an altered oxidative status and signs of mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly due to iron mishandling. Thus, for the first time, altered biological processes have been identified in vitro in live diseased neurons. Moreover, the obtained induced neurons can be considered a suitable human neuronal model for the identification of candidate therapeutic compounds for this disease. "

The area postrema is one of the circumventricular organs, located on the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata at the caudal end of the fourth ventricle. Blood vessels in the area postrema lack a blood brain barrier, offering specific central neural elements unique access to circulating substances. Immunohistochemical studies show CCK-A receptors in the area postrema, and we reported CCK-sensitive area postrema neurons. However, the receptive mechanism of \{CCK\} in area postrema neurons still remains unexplained. We investigated the responses of area postrema neurons to agonists and antagonists of \{CCK\} receptors using whole cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings in rat brain slices. The application of CCK-8 elicited excitatory responses, such as increases in the frequency of mEPSCs (miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents), a shift toward larger amplitude mEPSCs, and increases in the frequency of action potentials. These changes were found mostly in cells not displaying the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), except for small excitatory changes in a minority of Ih-positive neurons. Tonic inward currents or an inhibitory response to CCK-8 were never seen. Analysis of the amplitude of mEPSCs before and after the administration of CCK-8 indicated the responses mediated via the presynaptic receptors. The effect of CCK-8 was abolished in the presence of \{CNQX\} (AMPA type glutamate receptor antagonist). In the presence of lorglumide (a selective CCK-A receptor antagonist), CCK-8-induced excitatory responses were inhibited. No cells responded to the administration of non-sulfated CCK-8 (CCK-8NS, a selective CCK-B receptor agonist). We conclude that CCK-8 exerts its action via presynaptic CCK-A receptors to facilitate glutamate release onto Ih-negative area postrema cells. "

Drosophila stl encodes an \{ADAMTS\} protease expressed in and around the peripheral nervous system (PNS) during embryogenesis. The absence of stl displayed one specific neuron, the v'ch1 sensory neuron, migrating to its target sooner than in wild type. During normal development, the v'ch1 sensory neuron migrates dorsally at the same time it is extending an axon ventrally toward the CNS. Surprisingly, in the absence of stl, the v'ch1 neuron migrated further dorsally as compared to the wild type at stage 15, but did not migrate past its correct target at stage 16, suggesting a novel role for this extracellular protease in inhibiting migration of this neuron past a certain point.

In this study, we examined the expression of syndecan-1, a type of HSPG, in primary sensory neurons after nerve injury in mice. Sciatic nerve axotomy strongly induced the expression of syndecan-1 in a subpopulation of injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which were small in size and had CGRP- or isolectin B4-positive fibers. Syndecan-1 was also distributed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord ipsilateral to the axotomy, and located on the membrane of axons in lamina \{II\} of the dorsal horn. Not only sciatic nerve axotomy, infraorbital nerve axotomy also induced the expression of syndecan-1 in trigeminal ganglion neurons. Moreover, syndecan-1 knockdown in cultured \{DRG\} neurons induced a shorter neurite extension. These results suggest that syndecan-1 expression in injured primary sensory neurons may have functional roles in nerve regeneration and synaptic plasticity, resulting in the development of neuropathic pain.

Calcium is mobilized from the \{ER\} store by multiple signaling cascades, and neuronal activity is known to regulate \{ER\} calcium levels. We asked how neurons regulate \{ER\} calcium levels in the resting state. Direct \{ER\} calcium imaging showed that \{ER\} calcium was lost quite rapidly from the somatic and dendritic \{ER\} when resting neurons were transiently kept under calcium-free conditions. Interestingly, free \{ER\} and free cytosolic calcium was lost continuously across the plasma membrane and was not held back in the cytosol, implying the presence of a prominent calcium influx mechanism to maintain \{ER\} calcium levels at rest. When neurons were treated acutely with inhibitors of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), an immediate decline in \{ER\} calcium levels was observed. This continuous SOCE-like calcium entry did not require the activation of a signaling cascade, but was rather a steady-state phenomenon. The SOCE-like mechanism maintains medium–high \{ER\} calcium levels at rest and is essential for balanced resting calcium levels in the \{ER\} and cytosol. "

abstract = "Abstract Reduced olfactory sensitivity has been reported in depressive disorder. However, the pathological mechanism is still unclear. The reduced olfactory bulb (OB) volume and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis has been unraveled in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, changes in olfactory epithelium (OE) have not been reported, which might contribute to olfactory deficits in MDD. In the context, we investigated the thickness of \{OE\} in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Simultaneously, the basal cells (labeled by nerve growth factor receptor (p75NGFR)), immature olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) (marked by growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43)) and mature \{ORNs\} (labeled by olfactory marker protein (OMP)) in \{OE\} were detected by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the thickness of OE, the number of basal cells, immature \{ORNs\} as well as mature \{ORNs\} decreased dramatically in the \{OE\} of \{CUMS\} rats. Those findings indicate that the reduced number of \{ORNs\} might induce \{OE\} atrophy in \{CUMS\} rats and the abnormalities of the \{OE\} may be partially responsible for the reduced olfactory sensitivity in MDD.

In motor neurons, \{NRG1\} expression is regulated by activity and neurotrophic factors, however, little is known about what controls isoform-specific transcription. Here we show that \{NRG1\} expression in the chick embryo increases in motor neurons that have extended their axons and that limb bud ablation before motor axon outgrowth prevents this induction, suggesting a trophic role from the developing limb. Consistently, \{NRG1\} induction after limb bud ablation can be rescued by adding back the neurotrophic factors \{BDNF\} and GDNF. Mechanistically, \{BDNF\} induces a rapid and transient increase in type I and type \{III\} \{NRG1\} mRNAs that peak at 4 h in rat embryonic ventral spinal cord cultures. Blocking \{MAPK\} or \{PI3K\} signaling or blocking transcription with Actinomycin D blocks \{BDNF\} induced \{NRG1\} gene induction. \{BDNF\} had no effect on mRNA degradation, suggesting that transcriptional activation rather than message stability is important. Furthermore, \{BDNF\} activates a reporter construct that includes 700 bp upstream of the type I \{NRG1\} start site. Protein synthesis is also required for type I \{NRG1\} mRNA transcription as cycloheximide produced a super-induction of type I, but not type \{III\} \{NRG1\} mRNA, possibly through a mechanism involving sustained activation of \{MAPK\} and PI3K. These results reveal the existence of highly responsive, transient transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that differentially modulate \{NRG1\} isoform expression as a function of extracellular and intracellular signaling cascades and mediated by neurotrophic factors and axon–target interactions.

Although several brain structures are involved in compulsive behavior, it has been suggested that alterations in fronto-striatal circuits may underlie compulsive spectrum disorders. In the present work, we examined whether \{SIP\} would induce modifications in dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) neurons. Specifically, the effects of 20 sessions of \{SIP\} were determined in the dendrites of \{DLS\} medium spiny neurons and in the basal dendritic arbors of layer V pyramidal cells in the aPFC. The structure, size and branching complexity in aPFC neurons were also studied. Results showed that \{SIP\} resulted in an increase in dendritic spine density in \{DLS\} neurons. Moreover, dendritic spine density was highly correlated with the level of drinking in animals subjected to SIP. By contrast, we observed no differences either in dendritic spine density or in the morphological structure of the dendrites of the aPFC in \{SIP\} rats compared to their control counterparts. We hypothesize that SIP-induced structural plasticity in \{DLS\} neurons could be related to inflexible response in compulsive behavior. The findings of this study could provide new insights into the involvement of particular cell populations of the dorsolateral striatum and anterior prefrontal cortex regions in compulsive spectrum disorders.

In the monkey, mirror neurons characteristically fire not only when it is performing an action, such as grasping an object, but also when observing a similar action performed by another agent (human or monkey). In this review we discuss the origin, cortical distribution and possible functions of mirror neurons as a background to exploring their potential relevance in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have recently proposed that \{ALS\} (and the related condition of frontotemporal dementia) may be viewed as a failure of interlinked functional complexes having their origins in key evolutionary adaptations. This can include loss of the direct projections from the corticospinal tract, and this is at least part of the explanation for impaired motor control in ALS. Since, in the monkey, corticospinal neurons also show mirror properties, \{ALS\} in humans might also affect the mirror neuron system. We speculate that a defective mirror neuron system might contribute to other \{ALS\} deficits affecting motor imagery, gesture, language and empathy. "

Because of their central role in cell signaling, cellular PDZ-containing proteins are preferential targets of viruses to hijack cellular function to their advantage. Here, we describe how the viral G protein of the rabies virus specifically targets the \{PDZ\} domain of neuronal enzymes during viral infection. By disrupting the complexes formed by cellular enzymes and their ligands, the virus triggers drastic effect on cell signaling and commitment of the cell to either survival (virulent strains) or death (vaccinal strains). We provide structural and biological evidences that the viral proteins act as competitors endowed with specificity and affinity in an essential cellular process by mimicking \{PDZ\} binding motif of cellular partners. Disruption of critical endogenous protein–protein interactions by viral protein drastically alters intracellular protein trafficking and catalytic activity of cellular proteins that control cell homeostasis. This work opens up many perspectives to mimic viral sequences and developing innovative therapies to manipulate cellular homeostasis. "

This is particularly relevant for neurons, whose pathology is frequently associated with mitochondrial deficiencies.

When mitochondrial coupling impairs, so does cell metabolism, trafficking and the signaling depending on the homeostasis of the mitochondrial network. Moreover, the quality control of mitochondria – via the process of mitochondrial autophagy – results biased in neurodegeneration stemming major interest on the molecular determinants of this process among neuroscientists. In this review, we highlight the most notable and acknowledged deficiencies of mitochondrial function and their relationship with diseases occurring in neurons and their transmission. The physiological aspects of mitochondrial biology in relation to bio-energy, dynamics and quality control will be discussed with the finality to form a comprehensive picture of the mitochondrial contribution to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative syndromes. In this way we aim to set the scene to conceive novel strategies to better diagnose and target these debilitative conditions. "

We found that \{SKF83959\} induced an inhibition on \{VGSCs\} in a dose-dependent manner in striatal neurons (IC50 value: 3.31±0.39 μM), which could be prevented by antagonist of \{D1\} receptor, but not that of D2, α1 adrenergic, or cholinoceptor.

We investigated the role of Mindbomb (Mib)-mediated Notch signaling in the differentiation of neural progenitors during late neurogenesis by overexpressing Mib and administering \{RA\} to Tg[hsp70-Mib:EGFP]. The majority of cells in the p3 domain differentiated into \{GABAergic\} Kolmer–Agduhr (KA) cells in Tg[hsp70-mib:EGFP] embryos heat-shocked during late neurogenesis, whereas these phenotypes were suppressed by exogenous RA.

The unique configuration of motor neurons spanning the border between the \{CNS\} and \{PNS\} has been explained by structural barriers such as boundary cap (BC) cells, basal lamina and radial glia. However, mechanisms in motor neurons that retain their position have not been addressed yet. Here we demonstrate that the Islet1 (Isl1) and Islet2 (Isl2) transcription factors, which are essential for acquisition of motor neuron identity, also contribute to restrict motor neurons within the neural tube. In mice that lack both Isl1 and Isl2, large numbers of motor neurons exited the neural tube, even prior to the appearance of \{BC\} cells at the ventral exit points. Transcriptional profiling of motor neurons derived from Isl1 null embryonic stem cells revealed that transcripts of major genes involved in repulsive mechanisms were misregulated. Particularly, expression of Neuropilin1 (Npr1) and Slit2 mRNA was diminished in Islet mutant mice, and these could be target genes of the Islet proteins. Consistent with this mechanism, Robo and Slit mutations in mice and knockdown of Npr1 and Slit2 in chick embryos caused motor neurons to migrate to the periphery. Together, our study suggests that Islet genes engage Robo-Slit and Neuropilin–Semaphorin signaling in motor neurons to retain motor somata within the CNS. "

These neurodegenerative disorders, collectively known as synucleinopathies, are usually associated with cognitive impairment that could be caused by impaired hippocampal function. Although abnormal expressions of α-syn and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor are frequently observed in the hippocampus of patients with synucleinopathies, how these proteins interact with each other in hippocampal neurons remains poorly understood. In the present study, primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and α-syn transgenic mice were used to investigate the effect of α-syn on \{NMDA\} receptors. Neurons were treated either by direct addition of recombinant human α-syn (hα-syn) to the medium, or by infection with the hα-syn gene, to increase intracellular levels of α-syn. In both cases, \{NMDA\} receptor \{NR1\} subunits on the cell surface were reduced while the total amount of \{NR1\} was unchanged, indicating an internalization of \{NR1\} subunits. Neurons with elevated α-syn also showed a profound increase in Rab5B, an isoform of the small \{GTPases\} essential for \{NMDA\} receptor endocytosis. Knockdown of Rab5B expression by siRNA inhibited the α-syn-induced reduction in surface NR1. The in vitro findings were confirmed in α-syn transgenic mice, showing that increased α-syn expression was accompanied by reduced levels of surface \{NR1\} and increased expression of Rab5B. Due to the essential role of \{NR1\} subunits for assembling a complete \{NMDA\} receptor, its reduction on the cell surface indicated impaired receptor function. This was demonstrated by observations that neurons with elevated α-syn showed profound reductions in NMDA-elicited Ca2+ influx and inward current, which were also inhibited by knockdown of Rab5B expression. Our data suggest that increased α-syn expression may impair \{NMDA\} receptor function in the hippocampus by reducing the density of \{NR1\} subunits on the cell surface. "

Accordingly, we evaluated the role of autophagy in the cerebellum after global ischemia produced by asphyxial cardiac arrest in postnatal day (PND) 16–18 rats, using siRNA-targeted inhibition of Atg7, necessary for microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Atg12–Atg5 complex formation. Two days before a 9 min asphyxial cardiac arrest or sham surgery, Atg7 or control siRNA was injected intracisternally to target the cerebellum. Treatment with Atg7 siRNA: 1) reduced Atg7 protein expression in the cerebellum by 56%; 2) prevented the typical ischemia-induced formation of LC3-II in the cerebellum 24 h after asphyxial cardiac arrest; 3) improved performance on the beam-balance apparatus on days 1–5; and 4) increased calbindin-labeled Purkinje cell survival assessed on day 14. Improved Purkinje cell survival was more consistent in female vs. male rats, and improved beam-balance performance was only seen in female rats. Similar responses to Atg7 siRNA i.e. reduced autophagy and neurodegeneration vs. control siRNA were seen when exposing sex-segregated green fluorescent protein-LC3 tagged mouse primary cortical neurons to oxygen glucose deprivation in vitro.

Collaboration included the support of process outgrowth by clustering of satellite cells, induction of distal branching behavior by soma signaling, the capacity of satellite cells to respond to distal axon injury of its neighboring neurons, and evidence of direct neuron-satellite cell exchange. In vitro, closely adherent coharvested satellite cells routinely clustered around new outgrowing processes and groups of satellite cells attracted neurite processes. Similar clustering was encountered in the pseudounipolar processes of intact sensory neurons within intact \{DRG\} in vivo. While short term exposure of distal growth cones of unselected adult sensory neurons to transient gradients of a \{PTEN\} inhibitor had negligible impacts on their behavior, exposure of the soma induced early and substantial growth of their distant neurites and branches, an example of local soma signaling. In turn, satellite cells sensed when distal neuronal axons were injured by enlarging and proliferating. We also observed that satellite cells were capable of internalizing and expressing a neuron fluorochrome label, diamidino yellow, applied remotely to distal injured axons of the neuron and retrogradely transported to dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons. The findings illustrate a robust interaction between intranganglionic neurons and glial cells that involve two way signals, features that may be critical for both regenerative responses and ongoing maintenance.

Given that intraneuronal accumulation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) has been shown to exert deleterious effects on neurons, we tested potential accumulation of Aβ within \{BFCN\} in rhesus monkeys, which like the human display age-related accumulation of this peptide in plaques. The non-isoform-specific Aβ antibodies 1282 and 6E10 and the specific antibodies to 1–40 amino acid isoform of Aβ (Aβ1–40) and 1–42 amino acid isoform of Aβ (Aβ1–42) species were used in immunohistochemical experiments of basal forebrain in young and aged rhesus monkeys. All four antibodies visualized cortical plaques in the same sections in which \{BFCN\} were examined, in aged but not in young animals. The basal forebrain region within which the \{BFCN\} are localized was virtually free of plaques. Appreciable Aβ immunoreactivity was present within the nucleus basalis of Meynert–cholinergic cell group 4 (nbM–Ch4), the major component of BFCN, with all antibodies used. Quantitation of optical density indicated significant age-related increases in immunoreactivity in nbM–Ch4 neurons with the Aβ1–40 (p &lt; 0.002) and 1282 (p &lt; 0.03) antibodies. Immunoreactivity for 6E10 displayed a small, non-significant age-related increase in nbM–Ch4 neurons (p &gt; 0.05). No age-related changes were detected in Aβ1–42 immunoreactivity in these neurons. Unlike the BFCN, cortical neurons within the same sections were virtually devoid of Aβ immunoreactivity, particularly with isoform-specific antibodies. Both smooth and granular intraneuronal Aβ immunoreactivity, reminiscent of endosomal/lysosomal packaged peptide, were observed within nbM–Ch4 neurons. In some nbM–Ch4 neurons, 1282 immunoreactivity had the appearance of large peptide aggregates. Significant accumulation and age-related increase of Aβ in \{BFCN\} is likely to interfere with the normal functioning of these neurons.

abstract = "Abstract Ageing affects most, if not all, functional systems in the body. For example, the somatic motor nervous system, responsible for initiating and regulating motor output to skeletal musculature, is vulnerable to ageing. The nigrostriatal dopamine pathway is one component of this system, with deficits in dopamine signalling contributing to major motor dysfunction, as exemplified in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, while the dopamine deficit in \{PD\} is due to degeneration of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine (DA) neurons, it is unclear whether there is sufficient loss of \{SN\} \{DA\} neurons with ageing to explain observed motor impairments. Instead, evidence suggests that age-related loss of \{DA\} neuron function may be more important than frank cell loss. To further elucidate the mechanisms of functional decline, we have investigated age-related changes in gene expression specifically in laser microdissected \{SN\} \{DA\} neurons. There were significant age-related changes in the expression of genes associated with neurotrophic factor signalling and the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Furthermore, reduced expression of the \{DA\} neuron-associated transcription factor, Nurr1, may contribute to these changes. Together, these results suggest that altered neurotrophic signalling and tyrosine hydroxylase activity may contribute to altered \{DA\} neuron signalling and motor nervous system regulation in ageing.

In this study, we investigated the possible effect of minocycline on Ih of substantia gelatinosa neuron in superficial spinal dorsal horn by using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. We found that extracellular minocycline rapidly decreases Ih amplitude in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 41 μM). By contrast, intracellular minocycline had no effect. Minocycline-induced inhibition of Ih was not affected by Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin, glutamate-receptor antagonists (CNQX and D-APV), \{GABAA\} receptor antagonist (bicuculine methiodide), or glycine receptor antagonist (strychnine). Minocycline also caused a negative shift in the activation curve of Ih, but did not alter the reversal potential. Moreover, minocycline slowed down the inter-spike depolarizing slope and produced a robust decrease in the rate of action potential firing. Together, these results illustrate a novel cellular mechanism underlying minocycline's analgesic effect by inhibiting Ih currents of spinal dorsal horn neurons. "

Our present work aimed to evaluate the protective effect of \{TPM\} against glutamate toxicity in hippocampal neurons and further figure out the potential molecular mechanisms. The in vitro glutamate excitotoxic model was prepared with 125 μM glutamate for 20 min. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis and Hoechst 33342 staining were conducted to detect neuronal survival. The protein expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), TrkB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK), cyclic \{AMP\} response element binding protein (CREB), Bcl-2, Bax and β-actin were detected via Western blot assay. Our results demonstrated that \{TPM\} protected hippocampal neurons from glutamate toxicity. Meanwhile, the pretreatment of \{TPM\} for 10 min significantly prevented the down-regulation of \{BDNF\} and the phosphorylation of TrkB. Furthermore, the elevation of phosphorylated \{EKR\} expression was significantly inhibited after blockade of TrkB by TrkB IgG, while no alterations of phosphorylated \{JNK\} and p38 \{MAPK\} were found in the cultured hippocampal neurons. Besides, it was also found that the enhanced phosphorylation of \{CREB\} was evidently reversed under excitotoxic conditions after treating with \{U0126\} (the selective inhibitor of ERK). The protein level of Bcl-2 was also observed to be remarkably increased after \{TPM\} treatment. In conclusion, these findings implicate that \{TPM\} exerts neuroprotective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity in hippocampal neurons and its protection may be modulated through BDNF/TrkB-dependent \{ERK\} pathway.

Pharmacological studies indicated that \{P2X3\} was expressed in the H/Ho-OSNs, modulating both heptaldehyde (H) and 2-hepatanone (Ho)-induced responses. These data indicated that activation of purinergic receptor negatively modulated odor response, providing the evidence to support the possible protective effect of purinergic receptor in OSNs. "

Although anti-neuronal antibodies in patients bind to a restricted group of \{NSE\} in cerebral cortex, it has not yet been clarified how the anti-NSE antibody have negative impacts on cortical neurons. Here, we found that \{NSE\} was also localized at neuronal cell bodies and neuritis on the neuronal cell surface in the primary culture of rat cortical neurons. The anti-NSE antibody induced neuronal cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. The neuronal cell death required a lag time and was not accompanied with caspase-3 activation and chromatin condensation. The anti-NSE antibody elevated a level of intracellular \{H2O2\} prior to neuronal cell death. Catalase protected neurons from the anti-NSE antibody-induced \{H2O2\} generation and cell death. The post-treatment of neurons with catalase after the application of the anti-NSE antibody exhibited neuroprotective effects as well as the co-treatment. The cascade of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is one of signal transductions of H2O2. Among MAPK, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase partially contributed to the neurotoxicity of anti-NSE antibody. Thus, the anti-NSE antibody acted at the plasmalemmal NSE, produced H2O2, and caused neuronal cell death via non-apoptotic pathway in the cortical neurons. "

However, wind power has a non–schedulable nature due to the strong stochastic nature and dynamic uncertainty nature of wind speed. Therefore, wind speed prediction is an indispensable requirement for power system operators. Two new approaches for hourly wind speed prediction are developed in this study by integrating the single multiplicative neuron model and the iterated nonlinear filters for updating the wind speed sequence accurately. In the presented methods, a nonlinear state–space model is first formed based on the single multiplicative neuron model and then the iterated nonlinear filters are employed to perform dynamic state estimation on wind speed sequence with stochastic uncertainty. The suggested approaches are demonstrated using three cases wind speed data and are compared with autoregressive moving average, artificial neural network, kernel ridge regression based residual active learning and single multiplicative neuron model methods. Three types of prediction errors, mean absolute error improvement ratio and running time are employed for different models’ performance comparison. Comparison results from Tables 1–3 indicate that the presented strategies have much better performance for hourly wind speed prediction than other technologies. "

Here we test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated signaling links \{BMP\} receptor activation to dendritic growth. In cultured rat sympathetic neurons, exposure to any of the three mechanistically distinct antioxidants, diphenylene iodinium (DPI), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NGA) or desferroxamine (DFO), blocked de novo BMP-induced dendritic growth. Addition of \{DPI\} to cultures previously induced with \{BMP\} to extend dendrites caused dendritic retraction while \{DFO\} and \{NGA\} prevented further growth of dendrites. The inhibition of the dendrite promoting activity of \{BMPs\} by antioxidants was concentration-dependent and occurred without altering axonal growth or neuronal cell survival. Antioxidant treatment did not block \{BMP\} activation of \{SMAD\} 1,5 as determined by nuclear localization of these SMADs. While \{BMP\} treatment did not cause a detectable increase in intracellular \{ROS\} in cultured sympathetic neurons as assessed using fluorescent indicator dyes, \{BMP\} treatment increased the oxygen consumption rate in cultured sympathetic neurons as determined using the Seahorse \{XF24\} Analyzer, suggesting increased mitochondrial activity. In addition, \{BMPs\} upregulated expression of \{NADPH\} oxidase 2 (NOX2) and either pharmacological inhibition or siRNA knockdown of \{NOX2\} significantly decreased BMP-7 induced dendritic growth. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that \{ROS\} are involved in the downstream signaling events that mediate BMP7-induced dendritic growth in sympathetic neurons, and suggest that ROS-mediated signaling positively modulates dendritic complexity in peripheral neurons.

GnRH neurons express the ultra-sensitive energy sensor adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK); here, we investigated the hypothesis that GnRH nerve cell \{AMPK\} and peptide neurotransmitter responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia are controlled by hindbrain lack of the oxidizable glycolytic end-product l-lactate. Data show that hypoglycemic inhibition of \{LH\} release in steroid-primed ovariectomized female rats was reversed by coincident caudal hindbrain lactate infusion. Western blot analyses of laser-microdissected \{A2\} neurons demonstrate hypoglycemic augmentation [Fos, estrogen receptor-beta (ER-β), phosphoAMPK (pAMPK)] and inhibition (dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, GLUT3, MCT2) of protein expression in these cells, responses that were normalized by insulin plus lactate treatment. Hypoglycemia diminished rostral preoptic GnRH nerve cell GnRH-I protein and pAMPK content; the former, but not the latter response was reversed by lactate.

We therefore exposed wild-type embryos to the metals copper (CuSO4), cadmium (CdCl2) and cobalt (CoSO4) for 72 h to determine lethal as well as sublethal morphological effects. Motor neuron damage was investigated by immunofluorescence staining of primary motor neurons (PMNs) and secondary motor neurons (SMNs). In vivo stainings using the vital dye \{DASPEI\} were used to quantify neuromast development and damage. The consequences of metal toxicity were also assessed functionally, by testing fish behavior following tactile stimulation. The median effective concentration (EC50) values for morphological effects 72 h post fertilization (hpf) were 14.6 mg/L for cadmium and 0.018 mg/L for copper, whereas embryos exposed up to 45.8 mg/L cobalt showed no morphological effects. All three metals caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the numbers of normal \{PMNs\} and SMNs, and in the fluorescence intensity of neuromasts. The results for motor neuron damage and behavior were coincident for all three metals. Even the lowest metal concentrations (cadmium 2 mg/L, copper 0.01 mg/L and cobalt 0.8 mg/L) resulted in neuromast damage. The results demonstrate that the neuromast cells were more sensitive to metal exposure than morphological traits or the response to tactile stimulation and motor neuron damage. "

The most important result present 62.2% of misclassified neurons in border neurons group which is even greater than number of correctly classified neurons (37.8%) in that group, showing obvious failure of network to classify neurons correctly based on computational parameters used in our study. On the virtual sample 97.3% of misclassified neurons in border neurons group which is much greater than number of correctly classified neurons (2.7%) in that group, again confirms obvious failure of network to classify neurons correctly. Statistical analysis shows that there is no statistically significant difference in between central and border neurons for each measured parameter (p&gt;0.05). Total of 96.74% neurons are morphologically classified correctly by neural networks and each one belongs to one of the four histomorphological types: (a) neurons with small soma and short dendrites, (b) neurons with small soma and long dendrites, (c) neuron with large soma and short dendrites, (d) neurons with large soma and long dendrites. Statistical analysis supports these results (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion Human dentate nucleus neurons can be classified in four neuron types according to their quantitative histomorphological properties. These neuron types consist of two neuron sets, small and large ones with respect to their perykarions with subtypes differing in dendrite length i.e. neurons with short vs. long dendrites. Besides confirmation of neuron classification on small and large ones, already shown in literature, we found two new subtypes i.e. neurons with small soma and long dendrites and with large soma and short dendrites. These neurons are most probably equally distributed throughout the dentate nucleus as no significant difference in their topological distribution is observed. "

abstract = "Abstract Peripheral neuropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes mellitus and a common symptom of neuropathic pain, the mechanism of which is complex and involves both peripheral and central components of the sensory system. The lamina \{II\} of the medullary dorsal horn, called the substantia gelatinosa (SG), is well known to be a critical site for processing of orofacial nociceptive information. Although there have been a number of studies done on diabetic neuropathy related to the orofacial region, the action of neurotransmitter receptors on \{SG\} neurons in the diabetic state is not yet fully understood. Therefore, we used the whole-cell patch clamp technique to investigate this alteration on \{SG\} neurons in both streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and offspring from diabetic female mice. \{STZ\} (200 mg/kg)-injected mice showed a small decrease in body weight and a significant increase in blood glucose level when compared with their respective control group. However, application of different concentrations of glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate on \{SG\} neurons from STZ-injected mice did not induce any significant differences in inward currents when compared to their control counterparts. On the other hand, the offspring of diabetic female mice (induced by multiple injections of \{STZ\} (40 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days) led to a significant decrease in both body weight and blood glucose level compared to the control offspring. Glycine and glutamate responses in the \{SG\} neurons of the offspring from diabetic female mice were similar to those of control offspring. However, the \{GABA\} response in \{SG\} neurons of offspring from diabetic female mice was greater than that of control offspring. Furthermore, the GABA-mediated responses in offspring from diabetic and control mice were examined at different concentrations ranging from 3 to 1,000 μM. At each concentration, the GABA-induced mean inward currents in the \{SG\} neurons of offspring from diabetic female mice were larger than those of control mice. These results demonstrate that \{SG\} neurons in offspring from diabetic mice are more sensitive to \{GABA\} compared to control mice, suggesting that \{GABA\} sensitivity may alter orofacial pain processing in offspring from diabetic female mice.

To analyze \{STAM2\} in the nervous system, its gene expression and protein localization in the mouse brain were identified using three methods: mRNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and via lacZ reporter in frame with Stam2 gene using the gene trap mouse line Stam2Gt1Gaj. \{STAM2\} intracellular localization was analyzed by subcellular fractionation and co-immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Stam2 was strongly expressed in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, hippocampal formation, olfactory bulb, and medial habenula. The majority of STAM2-positive cells co-stained with the neuronal markers. In neurons \{STAM2\} was found in the early endosomes and also in the nucleus. The other members of the ESCRT-0 complex co-localized with \{STAM2\} in the cytoplasm, but they were not present in the nucleus. The newly identified neuron-specific nuclear localization of STAM2, together with its high expression in the brain indicated that \{STAM2\} might have a specific function in the mouse nervous system.

Principal cells in the \{NAc\} are medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which constitute the majority (90–95%) of \{NAc\} neuron populations in rodents. \{MSNs\} are mutually connected to form networks of lateral inhibition. Our previous study showed that activation of D2-like receptors presynaptically inhibited \{GABAergic\} transmission between MSN–MSN connections in the NAc. D2-like receptors in \{MSNs\} have been reported to consist of \{D2\} and \{D3\} receptors, but their functional roles remain to be elucidated. This study, therefore, aimed at examining the effects of \{D3\} receptor activation on MSN–MSN connections using PD128907, a preferential \{D3\} dopamine receptor agonist, and whole cell recordings from \{MSNs\} in acute slices including the NAc. In more than half of cells tested, \{PD128907\} reduced the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the agonist caused multiple actions, namely, decrease, increase and no significant changes, in the amplitude as well as the frequency of sIPSCs in individual cells. Our data, together with the results from previous studies, show that dopamine could suppress \{GABAergic\} transmission, i.e., lateral inhibition between some of MSNs, via activation of both \{D2\} and \{D3\} receptors.

We have shown previously that Wnt5a activates non-canonical Wnt signaling to stimulate postsynaptic differentiation in excitatory hippocampal neurons promoting the clustering of the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 and the development of dendritic spines. At least three different kinds of Wnt receptors have been associated with Wnt5a signaling: seven trans-membrane Frizzled receptors and the tyrosine kinase receptors Ryk and ROR2. We report here that \{ROR2\} is distributed in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons in close proximity to synaptic contacts and it is contained in dendritic spine protrusions. We demonstrate that \{ROR2\} is necessary to maintain dendritic spine number and morphological distribution in cultured hippocampal neurons. \{ROR2\} overexpression increased dendritic spine growth without affecting the density of dendritic spine protrusions in a form dependent on its extracellular Wnt binding cysteine rich domain (CRD) and kinase domain. Overexpression of dominant negative \{ROR2\} lacking the extracellular \{CRD\} decreased spine density and the proportion of mushroom like spines, while \{ROR2\} lacking the C-terminal and active kinase domains only affected spine morphology. Our results indicate a crucial role of the \{ROR2\} in the formation and maturation of the postsynaptic dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons. "

Deficiencies in \{BDNF\} signaling have been shown to cause severe obesity in humans; however, it remains unknown how \{BDNF\} signaling impacts the organization of neuronal circuits that control energy balance. Methods We examined the role of \{BDNF\} on survival, axonal projections, and synaptic inputs of neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARH), a structure critical for the control of energy balance, using Bdnfklox/klox mice, which lack long 3′ \{UTR\} Bdnf mRNA and develop severe hyperphagic obesity. Results We found that a small fraction of neurons that express the receptor for BDNF, TrkB, also expressed proopiomelanocortin (POMC) or neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related protein (AgRP) in the ARH. Bdnfklox/klox mice had normal numbers of POMC, NPY, and TrkB neurons in the ARH; however, retrograde labeling revealed a drastic reduction in the number of \{ARH\} axons that project to the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) in these mice. In addition, fewer \{POMC\} and AgRP axons were found in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) and the lateral part of PVH, respectively, in Bdnfklox/klox mice. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the impact of \{BDNF\} deficiency on inputs to \{ARH\} neurons. We found that excitatory inputs onto \{POMC\} and \{NPY\} neurons were increased and decreased, respectively, in Bdnfklox/klox mice, likely due to a compensatory response to marked hyperphagia displayed by the mutant mice. Conclusion This study shows that the majority of TrkB neurons in the \{ARH\} are distinct from known neuronal populations and that \{BDNF\} plays a critical role in directing projections from these neurons to the \{DMH\} and PVH. We propose that hyperphagic obesity due to \{BDNF\} deficiency is in part attributable to impaired axonal growth of TrkB-expressing \{ARH\} neurons. "

In this study, we demonstrated that burn injury induced spinal cord ventral horn motor neuron (VHMN) apoptosis and subsequently caused muscle atrophy and revealed the potential protection of autologous adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) transplantation on spinal cord \{VHMNs\} and muscle against burn injury. Methods Third-degree hind-paw burns were established by contact with a 75°C metal surface for 10 seconds. Adipose tissues were harvested from the groin fat pad, expanded in culture and labeled with chloromethyl-benzamido/1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′- tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate. The \{ASCs\} were transplanted into the injured hind paw at 4 weeks after burn injury. The lumbar spinal cord, sciatic nerve, gastrocnemius muscle and hind-paw skin were processed for immunofluorescent staining at 4 weeks after transplantation, including terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TUNEL) assay, caspase-3, caspase-9, \{CD\} 90 and S100, and the gastrocnemius muscle was evaluated through the use of hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results Caspase-3–positive, caspase-9–positive and TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in the corresponding dermatome spinal cord \{VHMNs\} after burn injury. Moreover, the decrease of Schwann cells in sciatic nerve and the increase of denervation atrophy in gastrocnemius muscle were observed. Furthermore, \{ASCs\} transplantation significantly attenuated apoptotic death of \{VHMNs\} and the area of muscle denervation atrophy in the gastrocnemius muscle fibers. Conclusions The animal model of third-degree burns in the hind paw showed significant apoptosis in the corresponding spinal cord VHMNs, which suggests that neuroprotection might be the potentially therapeutic target in burn-induced muscle atrophy. \{ASCs\} have potential neuroprotection against burn injuries through its anti-apoptotic effects.

Motivated by these findings, in the present research, a digital neuromorphic circuit to study neuron–astrocyte interaction is proposed. In this digital circuit, the firing dynamics of the neuron is described by Izhikevich model and the calcium dynamics of a single astrocyte is explained by a functional model introduced by Postnov and colleagues. For digital implementation of the neuron–astrocyte signaling, Single Constant Multiply (SCM) technique and several linear approximations are used for efficient low-cost hardware implementation on digital platforms. Using the proposed neuron–astrocyte circuit and based on the results of \{MATLAB\} simulations, hardware synthesis and \{FPGA\} implementation, it is demonstrated that the proposed digital astrocyte is able to change the firing patterns of the neuron through bidirectional communication. Utilizing the proposed digital circuit, it will be illustrated that information processing in synaptic clefts is strongly regulated by astrocyte. Moreover, our results suggest that the digital circuit of neuron–astrocyte crosstalk produces diverse neural responses and therefore enhances the information processing capabilities of the neuromorphic circuits. This is suitable for applications in reconfigurable neuromorphic devices which implement biologically brain circuits. "

We have previously shown, using a modified version of the lumbar 5 (L5)-spinal nerve ligation model of \{PNP\} (mSNA model involving L5-spinal nerve axotomy plus loose ligation of the lumbar 4 (L4)-spinal nerve with neuroinflammation-inducing chromic-gut), that \{L4\} \{DRG\} neurons exhibit increased spontaneous activity, the key characteristic of neuronal hyperexcitability. The underlying ionic and molecular mechanisms of the hyperexcitability of \{L4\} \{DRG\} neurons are incompletely understood, but could result from changes in expression and/or function of ion channels including hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which are active near the neuron’s resting membrane potential, and which produce an excitatory inward current that depolarizes the membrane potential toward the threshold of action potential generation. Therefore, in the present study we used the mSNA model to investigate whether: (a) expression of HCN1–HCN3 channels is altered in \{L4\} \{DRG\} neurons which, in the mSNA model, are essential for transmission of the evoked pain, and which contribute to chronic spontaneous pain, and (b) local (intraplantar) blockade of these \{HCN\} channels, with a specific blocker, ZD7288, attenuates chronic spontaneous pain and/or evoked pain in mSNA rats. We found 7 days after mSNA: (1) a significant increase in HCN2-immunoreactivity in small (&lt;30 μm) \{DRG\} neurons (predominantly IB4-negative neurons), and in the proportion of small neurons expressing \{HCN2\} (putative nociceptors); (2) no significant change in HCN1- or HCN3-immunoreactivity in all cell types; and (3) attenuation, with \{ZD7288\} (100 μM intraplantar), of chronic spontaneous pain behavior (spontaneous foot lifting) and mechanical, but not, heat hypersensitivity. The results suggest that peripheral \{HCN\} channels contribute to mechanisms of spinal nerve injury-induced PNP, and that \{HCN\} channels, possibly HCN2, represent a novel target for \{PNP\} treatment.

Increasing evidence suggests that axon guidance molecules including semaphorins and plexins participate in synapse formation and elimination. Although class B plexins are widely expressed in the brain, their role in the nervous system remains poorly characterized. We previously identified that B-plexins modulate microtubule dynamics and through this impact dendrite growth in rat hippocampal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that Plexin-B2 and Plexin-B3 are present in dendrites, but do not localize in synapses. We find that overexpression of all B-plexins leads to decreased volume of excitatory synapses, and at the same time Plexin-B1 and Plexin-B3 promote inhibitory synapse assembly. Plexin-B3 mutants revealed that these processes use different downstream pathways. While elimination of excitatory synapses is the result of Plexin-B3 binding to microtubule end binding proteins \{EB1\} and EB3, the increase in inhibitory synapses is mediated by regulation of Ras and Rho GTPases. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Plexin-B3 contributes to regulating synapse formation. "

Although the cortical areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), receive dense hypocretinergic fibers and express its receptors, it remains unclear whether the hypocretins can directly regulate the neural activity of the mPFC in vivo. In the present study, using multiple-channel single-unit recording study, we found that infusion of the SB-334867, a blocker for the Hcrtr1, beside the recording sites within the mPFC substantially exerted an inhibitory effect on the putative pyramidal neuron (PPN) activity in naturally behaving rats. In addition, functional blockade of the Hcrtr1 also selectively reduced the power of the gamma oscillations. The \{PPN\} activity and the power of the neural oscillations were not affected after microinjection of the TCS-OX2-29, a blocker for the Hcrtr2, within the mPFC. Together, these data indicate that endogenous hypocretins acting on the Hcrtr1 are required for the normal neural activity in the mPFC in vivo, and thus might directly contribute cortical arousal and mPFC-dependent cognitive processes.

Our findings demonstrated that nano-TiO2 crossed the membrane into the cytoplasm or nucleus, and significantly suppressed dendritic growth of primary cultured hippocampal neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, nano-TiO2 induced a marked release of glutamate to the extracellular region, decreased glutamine synthetase activity and increased phosphate-activated glutaminase activity, elevated intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), down-regulated protein expression of NR1, \{NR2A\} and NR2B, and increased the amplitudes of the \{INa\} and IK. In addition, nano-TiO2 increased nitric oxide and nitrice synthase, attenuated the activities of Ca2+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase, and increased the ADP/ATP ratio in the primary neurons.

In mouse models of AD, pharmacological inhibition using small molecule enzyme inhibitors or genetic inactivation of acyl-coenzyme A (Acyl-CoA):cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) diminished amyloidopathy and restored cognitive deficits. In microglia, \{ACAT1\} blockage increases autophagosome formation and stimulates amyloid β peptide1-42 degradation. Here, we hypothesize that in neurons \{ACAT1\} blockage augments autophagy and increases autophagy-mediated degradation of P301L-tau protein. We tested this possibility in murine neuroblastoma cells ectopically expressing human tau and in primary neurons isolated from triple transgenic \{AD\} mice that express mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1, and human tau. The results show that \{ACAT1\} blockage increases autophagosome formation and decreases P301L-tau protein content without affecting endogenous mouse tau protein content. In vivo, lacking Acat1 decreases P301L-tau protein content in the brains of young triple transgenic \{AD\} mice but not in those of old mice, where extensive hyperphosphorylations and aggregation of P301L-tau take place. These results suggest that, in addition to ameliorating amyloidopathy in both young and old \{AD\} mice, \{ACAT1\} blockage may benefit \{AD\} by reducing tauopathy at early stage. "

Among the specialized ORNs, seven classes of \{ORNs\} exhibited high specificity to 1,8-cineole, (±)-citronellal, myrcene, (±)-linalool and (E)-β-caryophyllene, major volatiles produced by eucalypts, while nine other classes of \{ORNs\} showed highly specialized responses to green leaf volatiles, germacrene D, (E)-β-farnesene and geranyl acetate that are not produced by most eucalypts. We hypothesize that female U. lugens can recognize their host plants by detecting key host volatile compounds, using a set of \{ORNs\} tuned to host volatiles, and discriminate them from non-host plants using another set of \{ORNs\} specialized for non-host volatiles. The \{ORNs\} with broad response spectra may enhance the discrimination between host and non-host plants by adding moderately selective sensitivity. Based on our finding, it is suggested that phytophagous insects use the combinational input from both host-specific and non-host specific \{ORNs\} for locating their host plants, and the electrophysiological characterization of \{ORN\} profiles would be useful in predicting the range of host plants in phytophagous insects.

In rodent \{ALS\} models: 1) breathing capacity is preserved until late in disease progression despite major respiratory motor neuron death, suggesting unknown forms of compensatory respiratory plasticity; and 2) spinal microglia become activated in association with motor neuron cell death. Here, we report a novel experimental model to study the impact of respiratory motor neuron death on compensatory responses without many complications attendant to spontaneous motor neuron disease. In specific, we used intrapleural injections of cholera toxin B fragment conjugated to saporin (CTB –SAP) to selectively kill motor neurons with access to the pleural space. Motor neuron survival, \{CD11b\} labeling (microglia), ventilatory capacity and phrenic motor output were assessed in rats 3–28 days after intrapleural injections of: 1) CTB–SAP (25 and 50 μg), or 2) unconjugated \{CTB\} and \{SAP\} (i.e. control; (CTB + SAP). CTB–SAP elicited dose-dependent phrenic and intercostal motor neuron death; 7 days post-25 μg CTB–SAP, motor neuron survival approximated that in end-stage \{ALS\} rats (phrenic: 36 ± 7%; intercostal: 56 ± 10% of controls; n = 9; p &lt; 0.05). CTB–SAP caused minimal cell death in other brainstem or spinal cord regions. CTB–SAP: 1) increased \{CD11b\} fractional area in the phrenic motor nucleus, indicating microglial activation; 2) decreased breathing during maximal chemoreceptor stimulation; and 3) diminished phrenic motor output in anesthetized rats (7 days post-25 μg, CTB–SAP: 0.3 ± 0.07 V; \{CTB\} + SAP: 1.5 ± 0.3; n = 9; p &lt; 0.05).

abstract = "AbstractBackground Since task related neurons cannot be specifically targeted during surgery, a critical decision to make is to select which neurons are task-related when performing data analysis. Including neurons unrelated to the task degrade decoding accuracy and confound neurophysiological results. Traditionally, task-related neurons are selected as those with significant changes in firing rate when a stimulus is applied. However, this assumes that neurons’ encoding of stimuli are dominated by their firing rate with little regard to temporal dynamics. New method This paper proposes a systematic approach for neuron selection, which uses a likelihood ratio test to capture the contribution of stimulus to spiking activity while taking into account task-irrelevant intrinsic dynamics that affect firing rates. This approach is denoted as the model deterioration excluding stimulus (MDES) test. Results \{MDES\} is compared to firing rate selection in four case studies: a simulation, a decoding example, and two neurophysiology examples. Comparison with existing methods The \{MDES\} rankings in the simulation match closely with ideal rankings, while firing rate rankings are skewed by task-irrelevant parameters. For decoding, 95% accuracy is achieved using the top 8 MDES-ranked neurons, while the top 12 firing-rate ranked neurons are needed. In the neurophysiological examples, \{MDES\} matches published results when firing rates do encode salient stimulus information, and uncovers oscillatory modulations in task-related neurons that are not captured when neurons are selected using firing rates. Conclusions These case studies illustrate the importance of accounting for intrinsic dynamics when selecting task-related neurons and following the \{MDES\} approach accomplishes that. \{MDES\} selects neurons that encode task-related information irrespective of these intrinsic dynamics which can bias firing rate based selection.

Some suggest a link between \{TBI\} and motor neuron disease (MND), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To investigate the potential mechanisms linking \{TBI\} to MND, we measured motor function and neuropathology following mild-TBI in wild-type and a transgenic model of ALS, \{G93A\} mutant mice. Mild-TBI did not alter the lifespan of \{G93A\} mice or age of onset; however, rotarod performance was impaired in \{G93A\} verses wild-type mice. Grip strength was reduced only in \{G93A\} mice after mild-TBI. Increased electromyography (EMG) abnormalities and markers of denervation (AchR, Runx1) indicate that mild-TBI may result in peripheral effects that are exaggerated in \{G93A\} mice. Markers of inflammation (cell edema, astrogliosis and microgliosis) were detected at 24 and 72 h in the brain and spinal cord in wild-type and \{G93A\} mice. Levels of F2-isoprostanes, a marker of oxidative stress, were increased in the spinal cord 24 h post mild-TBI in wild-type mice but were not affected by \{TBI\} in \{G93A\} mice. In summary, our data demonstrate that mild-TBI induces inflammation and oxidative stress and negatively impacts muscle denervation and motor performance, suggesting mild-TBI can potentiate motor neuron pathology and influence the development of \{MND\} in mice.

Ghrelin, which is isolated from porcine stomach extract, is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). The widespread expression of ghrelin and GHS-R in the central nervous system during development suggests that ghrelin may be involved in developmental neural growth. However, its role in regulating fetal \{NPCs\} is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of ghrelin on primary cultured \{NPCs\} derived from fetal mouse telencephalon. The expressions of both ghrelin and its receptor were observed in \{NPCs\} using RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunocytostaining. Interestingly, the exposure of fetal \{NPCs\} to ghrelin at concentrations of 10−7 and 10−9 M suppressed their proliferation, and caused them to differentiate into neurons and to extend neurites. These results strongly suggest that ghrelin plays an autocrine modulatory role in fetal neural development. "

In the current study, we tried to observe the therapeutic potential of \{ROCK\} inhibitor Fasudil against dopaminergic neuron injury in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-mouse model of PD, and explore possible molecular mechanisms by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot and immunofluorescent assays. The results showed that MPTP-PD mice presented motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, activation of inflammatory response and oxidative stress as well as \{ROCK\} and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) signaling pathways. The administration of Fasudil exhibited neuroprotective effects against the dopaminergic neurons and improved the motor function recovery in the MPTP-PD mice, accompanied by the suppression of inflammatory responses (IL-1β, TNF-α, NF-κB-p65 and TLR-2), and oxidative stress (iNOS and gp91Phox), which might be associated with the inhibition of \{ROCK\} and GSK-3β activity. Simultaneously, the administration of Fasudil resulted in the shift from inflammatory \{M1\} to anti-inflammatory/neurorepair \{M2\} microglia. Additionally, Fasudil intervention enhanced the expression of anti-oxidative factors such as NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Hmox as well as neurotrophic factor including GDNF. Our observations defined the neuroprotective effects of Fasudil in MPTP-PD mice, and we found a series of novel effector molecules and pathways for explaining the neuroprotective effects against dopaminergic neurons. However, a lot of investigations are warranted to further elucidate the crosstalk among Fasudil, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, \{GDNF\} and ROCK/NF-kB/Nrf2 pathways in the therapeutic potential of PD.

Like other pesticides, fungicides are widely sprayed on agricultural land, especially in wine-growing areas, from where they can move-off after application. Furthermore, residues of these agrochemicals can remain on crops after harvest and even after some food processing operations, being a major exposure pathway. Although a relatively low toxicity has been claimed for this kind of compounds, information about their neurotoxicity is still scarce. In the present study, nine fungicides recently approved for agricultural uses in the \{EU\} ― ametoctradin, boscalid, cyazofamid, dimethomorph, fenhexamid, kresoxim-methyl, mepanipyrim, metrafenone and pyraclostrobin ― have been evaluated for their toxicity in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons. Exposure to 0.1–100 µM for 7 days in vitro resulted in a dose-dependent toxicity in the \{MTT\} cell viability assay. Strobilurin fungicides kresoxim-methyl (KR) and pyraclostrobin (PY) were the most neurotoxic compounds (lethal concentration 50 were in the low micromolar and nanomolar levels, respectively) causing a rapid raise in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i and strong depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. KR- and PY-induced cell death was reversed by the calcium channels blockers MK-801 and verapamil, suggesting that calcium entry through \{NMDA\} receptors and voltage-operated calcium channels are involved in KR- and PY-induced neurotoxicity.

However, not all motor neurons are equally vulnerable to disease; certain groups are spared, including those in the oculomotor nucleus controlling eye movement. The reasons for this differential vulnerability remain unknown. Here we have identified a protein signature for resistant oculomotor motor neurons and vulnerable hypoglossal and spinal motor neurons in mouse and man and in health and \{ALS\} with the aim of understanding motor neuron resistance. Several proteins with implications for motor neuron resistance, including \{GABAA\} receptor α1, guanylate cyclase soluble subunit alpha-3 and parvalbumin were persistently expressed in oculomotor neurons in man and mouse. Vulnerable motor neurons displayed higher protein levels of dynein, peripherin and \{GABAA\} receptor α2, which play roles in retrograde transport and excitability, respectively. These were dynamically regulated during disease and thus could place motor neurons at an increased risk. From our analysis is it evident that oculomotor motor neurons have a distinct protein signature compared to vulnerable motor neurons in brain stem and spinal cord, which could in part explain their resistance to degeneration in ALS. Our comparison of human and mouse shows the relative conservation of signals across species and infers that transgenic \{SOD1G93A\} mice could be used to predict mechanisms of neuronal vulnerability in man.

A role for abnormal direct neuronal insulin signaling has emerged as an important contributing factor in neurodegeneration.

Since the cortical and basolateral amygdalar nuclei have cortex-like cell types and have robust projections to the entorhinal cortex, we hypothesized that a small number of amygdalar \{GABAergic\} nonpyramidal neurons might participate in amygdalo-entorhinal projections. To test this hypothesis we combined Fluorogold (FG) retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry for the amygdalar nonpyramidal cell markers glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M2R). Injections of \{FG\} into the rat entorhinal cortex labeled numerous neurons that were mainly located in the cortical and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. Although most of these amygdalar FG+ neurons labeled by entorhinal injections were large pyramidal cells, 1–5% were smaller long-range nonpyramidal neurons (LRNP neurons) that expressed SOM, or both \{SOM\} and NPY. No amygdalar FG+ neurons in these cases were PV+ or VIP+. Cell counts revealed that \{LRNP\} neurons labeled by injections into the entorhinal cortex constituted about 10–20% of the total SOM+ population, and 20–40% of the total \{NPY\} population in portions of the lateral amygdalar nucleus that exhibited a high density of FG+ neurons. Sixty-two percent of amygdalar FG+/SOM+ neurons were GAD+, and 51% were M2R+. Since \{GABAergic\} projection neurons typically have low perikaryal levels of \{GABAergic\} markers, it is actually possible that most or all of the amygdalar \{LRNP\} neurons are GABAergic. Like \{GABAergic\} \{LRNP\} neurons in hippocampal/parahippocampal regions, amygdalar \{LRNP\} neurons that project to the entorhinal cortex are most likely involved in synchronizing oscillatory activity between the two regions. These oscillations could entrain synchronous firing of amygdalar and entorhinal pyramidal neurons, thus facilitating functional interactions between them, including synaptic plasticity. "

The genesis of these cells may be critical to the histological findings in type \{II\} FCD. Recent work has shown enhanced activation of the mTOR cascade in both balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons, suggesting a common pathogenesis for these two neuropathological hallmarks. A direct comparative analysis of balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons might identify a molecular link between balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons. Here, we addressed whether PDK1–AKT–mTOR activation differentiates balloon cells from dysmorphic neurons. We used immunohistochemistry with antibodies against phosphorylated (p)-PDK1 (Ser241), p-AKT (Thr308), p-AKT (Ser473), p-mTOR (Ser2448), p-P70S6K (Thr229), and p-p70S6 kinase (Thr389) in balloon cells compared with dysmorphic neurons. Strong or moderate staining for components of the PDK1–AKT–mTOR signaling pathway was observed in both balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons. However, only a few pyramidal neurons displayed weak staining in control group (perilesional neocortex and histologically normal neocortex). Additionally, p-PDK1 (Ser241) and p-AKT (Thr308) staining in balloon cells were stronger than in dysmorphic neurons, whereas p-P70S6K (Thr229) and p-p70S6 kinase (Thr389) staining in balloon cells was weaker than in dysmorphic neurons. In balloon cells, p-AKT (Ser473) and p-mTOR (Ser2448) staining was comparable with the staining in dysmorphic neurons. Our data support the previously suggested pathogenic relationship between balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons concerning activation of the PDK1–AKT–mTOR, which may play important roles in the pathogenesis of type \{II\} FCD. Differential expression of some components of the PDK1–AKT–mTOR pathway between balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons may result from cell-specific gene expression. "

We considered neuronal networks with different connection topologies and investigated the transition from a non-synchronized to a partially phase-synchronized state as the coupling strength is varied. The numerically determined critical coupling strength value for this transition to occur is compared with theoretical results valid for the generalized Kuramoto model. "

There is a need to develop electrodes which require less stimulation current for neuronal activation with physiologically relevant efficacy and frequencies. New method The objective of the present study was to examine and compare the stimulation efficiency of different electrode geometries at the resolution of a single neuron. We hypothesized that increasing the electrode perimeter will increase the maximum current density at the edges and enhance stimulation efficiency. To test this postulate, the neuronal stimulation efficacy of common circular electrodes (smallest perimeter) was compared with star (medium perimeter), and spiral (largest perimeter with internal boundaries) electrodes. We explored and compared using both a finite element model and in vitro stimulation of neurons isolated from Lymnaea central ganglia. Results Interestingly, both the computational model and the live neuronal stimulation experiments demonstrated that the common circular microelectrode requires less stimulus to activate a cell compared to the other two electrode shapes with the same surface area. Our data further revealed that circular electrodes exhibit the largest sealing resistance, stimulus transfer, and average current density among the three types of electrodes tested. Comparison with existing methods Average current density and not the maximum current density at the edges plays an important role in determining the electrode stimulation efficiency.

abstract = "Abstract Cysteine-rich motor neuron 1 (CRIM1) is upregulated only in extracellular matrix gels by angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It then plays a critical role in the tube formation of endothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of increased \{CRIM1\} on other endothelial functions such as proliferation and migration. Knock down of \{CRIM1\} had no effect on VEGF-induced proliferation or migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), indicating that basal \{CRIM1\} is not involved in the proliferation or migration of endothelial cells. Stable CRIM1-overexpressing endothelial F-2 cells, termed \{CR1\} and CR2, were constructed, because it was difficult to prepare monolayer \{HUVECs\} that expressed high levels of CRIM1. Proliferation was reduced and migration was accelerated in both \{CR1\} and \{CR2\} cells, compared with normal F-2 cells. Furthermore, the transient overexpression of \{CRIM1\} resulted in decreased proliferation and increased migration of bovine aortic endothelial cells. In contrast, neither proliferation nor migration of COS-7 cells were changed by the overexpression of CRIM1. These results demonstrate that increased \{CRIM1\} reduces the proliferation and accelerates the migration of endothelial cells. These \{CRIM1\} effects might contribute to tube formation of endothelial cells. \{CRIM1\} induced by angiogenic factors may serve as a regulator in endothelial cells to switch from proliferating cells to morphological differentiation.

Methods The rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, sham, OVX, OVX-soy (OVX-S), OVX-tamoxifen (OVX-T) and OVX-soy-tamoxifen (OVX-S-T). The animals of OVX-S, OVX-T and OVX-S-T groups received the soy extract (60 mg/kg; i.p.), tamoxifen (10 mg/kg) or both for 2 weeks before induction of seizures. The animals of these groups were also treated by soy extract, tamoxifen or both before each injection of \{PTZ\} (40 mg/kg) for 6 days. The animals of sham and \{OVX\} groups received saline plus tween instead of tamoxifen and soy extract. The animals of control group did not treat by PTZ, tamoxifen and soy. The rats were placed in Plexiglas cages separately and observed for 60 min. The brain tissues were then removed and subjected for histological studies. Results A significant decrease in the seizure score was seen in \{OVX\} group comparing to sham. The animals of both OVX-T and OVX-S groups had a significant higher seizure score compared to \{OVX\} group. Co-treatment of the ovariectomized rats by both soy extract and tamoxifen decreased the seizure score compared to OVX-S and OVX-T groups. The results of histological study showed that the dark neuron number in CA1, CA2, \{CA3\} and dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus area in OVX-T and OVX-S groups was higher than that of \{OVX\} group (P &lt; 0.05–P &lt; 0.01). In CA3, the produced dark neurons of OVX-S-T group were lower than that OVX-S group (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion The results of present study showed that treatment of the ovariectomized rats by either soy extract or tamoxifen increased the seizure score as well as dark neurons. Co-treatment with soy extract and tamoxifen did not potentiate the effects of each of them alone. Co-administration of the tamoxifen and soy extract inhibited the effects of the soy extract and tamoxifen when they administered alone. "

abstract = "Abstract Mirror neuron research has come a long way since the early 1990s, and many theorists are now stressing the heterogeneity and complexity of the sensorimotor properties of fronto-parietal circuits. However, core aspects of the initial ‘mirror mechanism’ theory, i.e. the idea of a symmetric encapsulated mirroring function translating sensory action perceptions into motor formats, still appears to be shaping much of the debate. This article challenges the empirical plausibility of the sensorimotor segregation implicit in the original mirror metaphor. It is proposed instead that the teleological organization found in the broader fronto-parietal circuits might be inherently sensorimotor. Thus the idea of an independent ‘purely perceptual’ goal understanding process is questioned. Further, it is hypothesized that the often asymmetric, heterogeneous and contextually modulated mirror and canonical neurons support a function of multisensory mapping and tracking of the perceiving agents affordance space. Such a shift in the interpretative framework offers a different theoretical handle on how sensorimotor processes might ground various aspects of intentional action choice and social cognition. Mirror neurons would under the proposed “social affordance model” be seen as dynamic parts of larger circuits, which support tracking of currently shared and competing action possibilities. These circuits support action selection processes—but also our understanding of the options and action potentials that we and perhaps others have in the affordance space. In terms of social cognition ‘mirror’ circuits might thus help us understand not only the intentional actions others are actually performing—but also what they could have done, did not do and might do shortly.

Increasing evidence indicated that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MTLE. In this study, we cultured primary hippocampal neurons, using IL-1β to mimic the process of inflammatory reaction in neurons, then inhibited the inflammation using inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The expression of proteins related to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in rat hippocampal neurons was detected by western blot, and similar methods were applied to the hippocampi obtained from children with \{MTLE\} and normal controls. Neuronal somatic size and dendritic length were measured by immunohistochemistry and digital imaging. We observed that stimulation with IL-1β in neuron led to the up-regulation of p-Akt and p70S6K and promoted the growth of cell somatic size and dendritic length via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Pre-treatment with inhibitors of the pathway, \{LY294002\} and rapamycin, decreased the expression of p-Akt and p70S6K and alleviated the morphological changes induced by IL-1β in hippocampal neurons. We further verified the increasement of P-Akt and p70S6K in the hippocampi of children with MTLE. These data are the first to demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by IL-1β promotes seizures and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of \{MTLE\} via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, modulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of MTLE. "

This paper is focused on further clarifying the origin of these new-born TH-positive neurons induced by exogenous APα treatment. We performed a deeper research in another \{AD\} mouse model, 4-month-old male APPswe/PSEN1 double transgenic \{AD\} mouse (2xTgAD) by measuring APα concentration and counting immunopositive neurons using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and unbiased stereology. It was found that endogenous APα level and the number of TH-positive neurons were reduced in the 2xTgAD mice, and these reductions were present prior to the appearance of β-amyloid (Aβ)-positive plaques. Furthermore, a single 20 mg/kg of exogenous APα treatment prevented the decline of total neurons, TH-positive neurons and TH/bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) double-positive neurons in the \{SNpc\} of 2xTgAD mice although the decreased intensity of TH-positive fibers was not rescued in the striatum. It was also noted that exogenous APα administration had an apparent increase in the doublecortin (DCX)-positive neurons and DCX/BrdU double-positive neurons of subventricular zone (SVZ), as well as in the percentage of neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN)/BrdU double-positive neurons of the \{SNpc\} in the 2xTgAD mice. These findings indicate that a lower level of endogenous APα is implicated in the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the 2xTgAD mice, and exogenous APα-induced a significant increase in the new-born dopaminergic neurons might be derived from the proliferating and differentiation of neural stem niche of SVZ.

abstract = "Abstract The vertebrate brain arises from the complex organization of millions of neurons. Neurogenesis encompasses not only cell fate specification from neural stem cells, but also the terminal molecular and morphological maturation of neurons at correct positions within the brain. RE1-silencing transcription factor (Rest) is expressed in non-neural tissues and neuronal progenitors where it inhibits the terminal maturation of neurons by repressing hundreds of neuron-specific genes. Here we show that Rest repression of maturation is intimately linked with the migratory capability of zebrafish facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), which undergo a characteristic tangential migration from hindbrain rhombomere (r) 4 to r6/r7 during development. We establish that \{FBMN\} migration is increasingly disrupted as Rest is depleted in zebrafish rest mutant embryos, such that around two-thirds of \{FBMNs\} fail to complete migration in mutants depleted of both maternal and zygotic Rest. Although Rest is broadly expressed, we show that de-repression or activation of Rest target genes only within \{FBMNs\} is sufficient to disrupt their migration. We demonstrate that this migration defect is due to precocious maturation of FBMNs, based on both morphological and molecular criteria. We further show that the Rest target gene and alternative splicing factor srrm4 is a key downstream regulator of maturation; Srrm4 knockdown partially restores the ability of \{FBMNs\} to migrate in rest mutants while preventing their precocious morphological maturation. Rest must localize to the nucleus to repress its targets, and its subcellular localization is highly regulated: we show that targeting Rest specifically to \{FBMN\} nuclei rescues \{FBMN\} migration in Rest-deficient embryos. We conclude that Rest functions in \{FBMN\} nuclei to inhibit maturation until the neurons complete their migration. "

We incorporate two adaptation currents, i.e., voltage-sensitive potassium current (IM) and calcium-sensitive potassium current (IAHP), into a reduced two-compartment neuron model, and extensively investigate the modeling behavior to a range of electric fields. With phase plane analysis, it is shown whether neuron continues to spike depends on whether adaptation currents could be sufficiently activated to stabilize membrane potential at subthreshold voltages. With stability and bifurcation analysis, we find the steady-state spiking in the neuron with \{IM\} occurs through a Hopf bifurcation, whereas it is generated through a saddle-node on invariant circle (SNIC) bifurcation in the cases of \{IAHP\} or no adaptation. By identifying the biophysical basis for these dynamics, we observe that \{IM\} could alter the competitive outcomes between kinetically mismatched opposite currents to result in a Hopf bifurcation, while \{IAHP\} cannot alter these competitive outcomes. From this, we conclude that different modulations of spike initiating dynamics derive from the biophysical mechanism responsible for distinct adaptation currents. Our study suggests that the adaptation mediated by different mechanisms indeed has different effects on neuronal dynamics to electric field stimulus. It could contribute to uncover the underlying mechanism of how neuron encodes electric field signals. "

Tissue enriched in the mPFC was processed for Western blot analysis and Golgi–Cox staining to investigate the long-lasting effects of \{CIE\} on the structure of mPFC neurons and the levels of myelin-associated proteins. \{PA\} increased dendritic arborization within apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. These changes occurred concurrently with hypophosphorylation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B (NR2B) at Tyr-1472. \{PA\} increased myelin basic protein (MBP) levels which occurred concurrently with hypophosphorylation of the premyelinating oligodendrocyte bHLH transcription factor Olig2 in the mPFC. Given that \{PA\} is associated with increased sensitivity to stress and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, and stress alters oligodendrocyte expression as a function of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation, the levels of total \{GR\} and phosphorylated \{GR\} were also evaluated. \{PA\} produced hypophosphorylation of the \{GR\} at Ser-232 without affecting expression of total protein. These findings demonstrate persistent and compensatory effects of ethanol in the mPFC long after cessation of CIE, including enhanced myelin production and impaired \{GR\} function. Collectively, these results suggest a novel relationship between oligodendrocytes and \{GR\} in the mPFC, in which stress may alter frontal cortex function in alcohol dependent subjects by promoting hypermyelination, thereby altering the cellular composition and white matter structure in the mPFC.

When aberrations in this process occur, cognitive disorders may result. Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have been reported to show altered neuronal connectivity and heterotopias. To elucidate pathways by which this process occurs and become aberrant, we have chosen to study the long isoform of nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP), a protein encoded by a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Methods To determine whether \{NOS1AP\} plays a role in cortical patterning, we knocked down or co-overexpressed \{NOS1AP\} and a green fluorescent protein or red fluorescent protein (TagRFP) reporter in neuronal progenitor cells of the embryonic rat neocortex using in utero electroporation. We analyzed sections of cortex (ventricular zone, intermediate zone, and cortical plate [CP]) containing green fluorescent protein or red fluorescent protein TagRFP positive cells and counted the percentage of positive cells that migrated to each region from at least three rats for each condition. Results \{NOS1AP\} overexpression disrupts neuronal migration, resulting in increased cells in intermediate zone and less cells in CP, and decreases dendritogenesis. Knockdown results in increased migration, with more cells reaching the CP. The phosphotyrosine binding region, but not the PDZ-binding motif, is necessary for \{NOS1AP\} function. Amino acids 181 to 307, which are sufficient for NOS1AP-mediated decreases in dendrite number, have no effect on migration. Conclusions Our studies show for the first time a critical role for the schizophrenia-associated gene \{NOS1AP\} in cortical patterning, which may contribute to underlying pathophysiology seen in schizophrenia.

Within these cell clusters, motor neurons receive afferent input and project their axons out to muscle targets. The molecular mechanisms that position motor neurons in the neural tube remain poorly understood. The floor plate produces several types of guidance cues with well-known roles in attracting and repelling axons, including the Slit family of chemorepellents via their Robo receptors, and Netrin1 via its \{DCC\} attractive receptor. In the present study we found that Islet1+ motor neuron cell bodies invaded the floor plate of Robo1/2 double mutant mouse embryos or Slit1/2/3 triple mutants. Misplaced neurons were born in their normal progenitor column, but then migrated tangentially into the ventral midline. Robo1 and 2 receptor expression in motor neurons was confirmed by reporter gene staining and anti-Robo antibody labeling. Mis-positioned motor neurons projected their axons longitudinally within the floor plate, and failed to reach their normal exit points. To test for potential counteracting ventral attractive signals, we examined Netrin-1 and \{DCC\} mutants, and found that motor neurons shifted dorsally in the hindbrain and spinal cord, suggesting that Netrin-1/DCC signaling normally attracts motor neurons closer to the floor plate.

abstract = "Background Myocardial infarction (MI) induces remodeling in stellate ganglion neurons (SGNs). Objective We investigated whether infarct site has any impact on the laterality of morphologic changes or neuropeptide expression in stellate ganglia. Methods Yorkshire pigs underwent left circumflex coronary artery (LCX; n = 6) or right coronary artery (RCA; n = 6) occlusion to create left- and right-sided MI, respectively (control: n = 10). At 5 ± 1 weeks after MI, left and right stellate ganglia (LSG and RSG, respectively) were collected to determine neuronal size, as well as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity. Results Compared with control, \{LCX\} and \{RCA\} \{MIs\} increased mean neuronal size in the \{LSG\} (451 ± 25 vs 650 ± 34 vs 577 ± 55 μm2, respectively; P = .0012) and \{RSG\} (433 ± 22 vs 646 ± 42 vs 530 ± 41 μm2, respectively; P = .002). \{TH\} immunoreactivity was present in the majority of SGNs. Both \{LCX\} and \{RCA\} \{MIs\} were associated with significant decreases in the percentage of TH-negative SGNs, from 2.58% ± 0.2% in controls to 1.26% ± 0.3% and 0.7% ± 0.3% in animals with \{LCX\} and \{RCA\} MI, respectively, for \{LSG\} (P = .001) and from 3.02% ± 0.4% in controls to 1.36% ± 0.3% and 0.68% ± 0.2% in \{LCX\} and \{RCA\} MI, respectively, for \{RSG\} (P = .002). Both TH-negative and TH-positive neurons increased in size after \{LCX\} and \{RCA\} MI. Neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity was also increased significantly by \{LCX\} and \{RCA\} \{MI\} in both ganglia. Conclusion Left- and right-sided \{MIs\} equally induced morphologic and neurochemical changes in \{LSG\} and \{RSG\} neurons, independent of infarct site. These data indicate that afferent signals transduced after \{MI\} result in bilateral changes and provide a rationale for bilateral interventions targeting the sympathetic chain for arrhythmia modulation.

First, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NSCs were induced to differentiate into cholinergic neuron-like cells (CNLs) with retinoic acid (RA) pre-induction followed by nerve growth factor (NGF) induction. Then, these \{CNLs\} were transplanted into bilateral hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Behavioral parameters showed by Morris water maze (MWM) tests and the percentages of GFP-labeled cholinergic neurons of \{CNL\} transplanted mice were compared with those of controls. Brain levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA and proteins were analyzed by quantitative real-time \{PCR\} and Western blotting, ChAT activity and acetylcholine (ACh) concentration were also evaluated by ChAT activity and \{ACh\} concentration assay kits. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that 80.3 ± 1.5% \{NSCs\} differentiated into \{CNLs\} after \{RA\} pre-induction followed by \{NGF\} induction in vitro. Three months after transplantation, 82.4 ± 6.3% \{CNLs\} differentiated into cholinergic neurons in vivo. APP/PS1 mice transplanted with \{CNLs\} showed a significant improvement in learning and memory ability compared with control groups at different time points. Furthermore, \{CNLs\} transplantation dramatically increased in the expressions of ChAT mRNA and protein, as well ChAT activity and \{ACh\} concentration in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings support the prospect of using NSC-derived \{CNLs\} in developing therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). "

The underlying pathogenesis of \{DPN\} is still elusive and an effective treatment devoid of side effects presents a challenge. There is evidence that in type-1 and -2 diabetes, metabolic and morphological changes lead to peripheral nerve damage and altered central nociceptive transmission, which may contribute to neuropathic pain symptoms. We characterized the electrophysiological response properties of spinal wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in three diabetic models. The streptozotocin (STZ) model was used as a drug-induced model of type-1 diabetes, and the BioBreeding/Worcester (BB/Wor) and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat models were used for genetic \{DPN\} models. Data were compared to the respective control group (BB/Wor diabetic-resistant, Zucker lean (ZL) and saline-injected Wistar rat). Response properties of \{WDR\} neurons to mechanical stimulation and spontaneous activity were assessed. We found abnormal response properties of spinal \{WDR\} neurons in all diabetic rats but not controls. Profound differences between models were observed. In BB/Wor diabetic rats evoked responses were increased, while in \{ZDF\} rats spontaneous activity was increased and in \{STZ\} rats mainly after discharges were increased. The abnormal response properties of neurons might indicate differential pathological, diabetes-induced, changes in spinal neuronal transmission. This study shows for the first time that specific electrophysiological response properties are characteristic for certain models of \{DPN\} and that these might reflect the diverse and complex symptomatology of \{DPN\} in the clinic.

In the “full-contact” co-culture, neurons and astrocytes in complete physical contact are “globally” exposed to m-DNB. A newly emergent “restricted-contact” co-culture is attained with a microfluidic device that polarizes neuron somas and neurites into separate compartments, and the neurite compartment is “selectively” exposed to m-DNB. Morphometric analysis of the neuronal area revealed that m-DNB exposure produced no significant change in mean neuronal cell area in “full-contact” co-cultures, whereas a significant decrease was observed for neuron monocultures. Neurite elaboration into a neurite exclusive compartment in a compartmentalized microfluidic device, for both monocultures (no astrocytes) and “restricted” co-cultures (astrocytes touching neurites), decreased with exposure to increasing concentrations of m-DNB, but the average neurite area was higher in co-cultures. By using co-culture systems that more closely approach biological and architectural complexities, and the directionality of exposure found in the brain, this study provides a methodological foundation for unraveling the role of physical contact between astrocytes and neurons in mitigating the toxic effects of chemicals such as m-DNB.

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of \{OT\} on the electrical properties of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the underlying mechanisms. \{DRG\} neurons from adult rats were acutely dissociated and cultured. Intracellular Ca2+ was determined by fluorescent microscopy using an indicator dye. The electrical properties of \{DRG\} neurons were tested by patch-clamp recording. The oxytocin receptor (OTR) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) on \{DRG\} neurons were assessed with immunofluorescence assays. \{OTR\} co-localized with nNOS in most of Isolectin \{B4\} (IB4)-binding cultured \{DRG\} neurons in rats. \{OT\} decreased the excitability, increased the outward current, and evoked the membrane hyperpolarization in cultured \{DRG\} neurons. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), the donor of nitric oxide (NO), exerted similar effects as \{OT\} on the membrane potential of cultured \{DRG\} neurons. \{OT\} increased the production of \{NO\} in \{DRGs\} and cultured \{DRG\} neurons. Pre-treatment of the \{OTR\} antagonist atosiban or the selective nNOS inhibitor N-Propyl-l-arginine (NPLA) significantly attenuated the hyperpolarization effect evoked by OT. \{OT\} produced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ in \{DRG\} neurons that responds to capsaicin, which can be attenuated by atosiban, but not by NPLA. OT-evoked membrane hyperpolarization and increase of outward current were distinctly attenuated by glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel. \{OT\} might be an endogenous antinociceptive agent and the peripheral antinociceptive effects of \{OT\} are mediated by activation of the Ca2+/nNOS/NO/KATP pathway in \{DRG\} neurons.

Importantly, both fluorescent proteins are fused to histone 2B protein (H2B) to confer nuclear localization to distinguish between single cells. We also constructed several expression constructs, including a tandem alignment of the neuron- and astrocyte-expression cassettes for simultaneous labeling. Introducing these vectors and constructs in vitro and in vivo resulted in cell type-specific and nuclear-localized fluorescence signals enabling easy detection and distinguishability of neurons and astrocytes. This tool is expected to be utilized for the simultaneous analysis of changes in neurons and astrocytes in healthy and diseased brains. "

Leptin, a permissive hormonal regulator of fertility, provides energy signal to brain. According to current view, leptin does not act directly on gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. RFRP-3 neurons have been shown to express leptin receptors. The goal of the present study was to examine whether leptin acts through RFRP-3 neurons to modulate activity of the GnRH neurons. For this aim, the effects of leptin on intracellular free Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) in RFRP-3 neurons were investigated by using in vitro calcium imaging system. In the present study, rHypoE-7 cell line was used as a model to explore the effects of leptin on RFRP-3 neurons. rHypoE-7 cells were placed on glass coverslip and loaded with 1 μM Fura-2 AM. [Ca2+]i responses were quantified by the changes in 340/380 ratio. Leptin (0.1–10 μM) caused increases in [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner. The changes in [Ca2+]i were significantly attenuated by pre-treatment with protein kinase C inhibitor. These results demonstrate that leptin activates intracellular calcium signaling in RFRP-3 neurons through PKC-dependent pathway, and thus leptin may exert its effect on GnRH neurons by means of RFRP-3 cells.

abstract = "Abstract Electrically coupled neurons communicate through channel assemblies called gap junctions, which mediate the transfer of current from one cell to another. Electrical synapses ensure spike synchronization and reliable transmission, which influences bursting patterns and firing frequency. The present study concerns an electrically coupled two-neuron network in the gastropod mollusc, Lymnaea stagnalis. The neurons, designated Visceral Dorsal 1 (VD1) and Right Parietal Dorsal 2 (RPD2), are peptidergic, innervate aspects of the cardio-respiratory system, and show strong coupling, such that they fire synchronously. Using dual sharp-electrode current-clamp recording and morphological staining in isolated brain preparations, the hypothesis that the electrical synapse is necessary for accurate network output was tested. We found that both cells make extensive projections within and out of the brain, including across the visceral–parietal connective, which links \{VD1\} and RPD2. Cutting this connective uncoupled the neurons and disrupted the firing rate and pattern of \{RPD2\} more than VD1, consistent with \{VD1\} being the master and \{RPD2\} the follower. The electrical synapse was inhibited by select gap junction blockers, with niflumic acid and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid decreasing the VD1→RPD2 and RPD2→VD1 coupling coefficients, whereas carbenoxolone, α-glycyrrhetinic acid, meclofenamic acid, and quinine were ineffective. There was little-to-no impact on VD1↔RPD2 firing synchrony or frequency when coupling was reduced pharmacologically. However, in the presence of gap junction blockers, suppressing the activity of \{VD1\} by prolonged hyperpolarization revealed a distinct, low-frequency firing pattern in RPD2. This suggests that strong electrical coupling is key to maintaining a synchronous output and proper firing rate. "

Under urethane anesthesia, rat stomachs were mounted on an ex vivo chamber and perfused with saline. Acid secretion had been inhibited by omeprazole. The secretion of HCO3− was measured at pH 7.0 using a pH-stat method and by the addition of 10 mM HCl. NaHS (0.5–10 mM) was perfused in the stomach for 5 min. Indomethacin or L-NAME was administered s.c. before NaHS treatment, while glibenclamide (a \{KATP\} channel blocker), ONO-8711 (an \{EP1\} antagonist), or propargylglycine (a cystathionine γ-lyase inhibitor) was given i.p. before. The mucosal perfusion of NaHS dose-dependently increased the secretion of HCO3−, and this effect was significantly attenuated by indomethacin, L-NAME, and sensory deafferentation, but not by glibenclamide or ONO-8711. The luminal output of nitric oxide, but not the mucosal production of prostaglandin E2, was increased by the perfusion of NaHS. Mucosal acidification stimulated HCO3− secretion, and this response was inhibited by sensory deafferentation, indomethacin, L-NAME, and ONO-8711, but not by propargylglycine.

To detect and monitor the 5-HT, effective and convenient methods are demanded in investigation of neuronal network. In this study, hippocampal neuronal networks (HNNs) endogenously expressing 5-HT receptors were employed as sensing elements to build an in vitro neuronal network-based biosensor. The electrophysiological characteristics were analyzed in both neuron and network levels. The firing rates and amplitudes were derived from signal to determine the biosensor response characteristics. The experimental results demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of 5-HT on hippocampal neuron activities, indicating the effectiveness of this hybrid biosensor in detecting 5-HT with a response range from 0.01 μmol/L to 10 μmol/L. In addition, the cross-correlation analysis of \{HNNs\} activities suggests 5-HT could weaken \{HNN\} connectivity reversibly, providing more specificity of this biosensor in detecting 5-HT. Moreover, 5-HT induced spatiotemporal firing pattern alterations could be monitored in neuron and network levels simultaneously by this hybrid biosensor in a convenient and direct way. With those merits, this neuronal network-based biosensor will be promising to be a valuable and utility platform for the study of neurotransmitter in vitro. "

We previously showed that the activation and nuclear localization of the core \{IFN\} signaling molecule, Stat1, are muted and delayed in primary mouse hippocampal neurons treated with \{IFN\} gamma as compared to control mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Here, we show that the kinetics of Stat1 and Stat2 activation following type I \{IFN\} exposure are also unique in neurons, affecting gene expression and neuronal response. Specifically, despite lower basal expression of many \{IFN\} stimulated genes in neurons, basal expression of the type I \{IFN\} themselves is significantly higher in primary hippocampal neurons compared to MEF. Elevated homeostatic \{IFN\} in neurons is critical and sufficient for early control of viral infection. These data provide further evidence that neurons exploit unique signaling responses to IFNs, and define an important contribution of homeostatic \{IFN\} within the CNS. Such differences are likely critical for the ability of neurons to survive a viral challenge. "

In this process, the power-law decay exponent of the resulting noise distribution is governed by the off-set of the multiplicative noise, thus allowing us to probe both regimes of Gaussian and strongly non-Gaussian noises. Ghost stochastic resonance, i.e., stochastic resonance in a missing fundamental harmonic, occurs in this model. Deviations from the Gaussianity of the input noise are shown to reduce both the additive noise intensity corresponding to the optimal identification of the missing fundamental as well as the number of firing events at the ghost stochastic resonance condition.

abstract = "Abstract Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) is a potent intestinotrophic growth factor with therapeutic potential in the treatment of intestinal deficiencies. It has recently been approved for the treatment of short bowel syndrome. The effects of GLP-2 are mediated by specific binding of the hormone to the GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) which was cloned in 1999. However, consensus about the exact receptor localization in the intestine has never been established. By physical, chemical and enzymatic tissue fragmentation, we were able to divide rat jejunum into different compartments consisting of: (1) epithelium alone, (2) mucosa with lamina propria and epithelium, (3) the external muscle coat including myenteric plexus, (4) a compartment enriched for the myenteric plexus and (5) intestine without epithelium. Expression of Glp2r; chromogranin A; tubulin, beta 3; actin, gamma 2, smooth muscle, enteric and glial fibrillary acidic protein in these isolated tissue fractions was quantified with qRT-PCR. Expression of the Glp2r was confined to compartments containing enteric neurons and receptor expression was absent in the epithelium. Our findings provide evidence for the expression of the GLP-2R in intestinal compartments rich in enteric neurons and, importantly they exclude significant expression in the epithelium of rat jejunal mucosa.

Alterations of spine shape, number, and density can be observed in different mental diseases, including those caused by developmental alcohol exposure. Pyramidal neurons of layer 2/3 are the most abundant cells of the neocortex and represent the main source of associative cortico-cortical connections. These neurons are essential for higher functions mediated by the cortex such as feature selection and perceptual grouping. Furthermore, their connections have been shown to be altered in experimental models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Here, we used a Golgi-like tracing method to study the spine density of layer 2/3 associative pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex of adult rats exposed to alcohol during the first postnatal week. The main result of the present study is represented by the decreased spine density in the apical dendrite of alcohol-treated rats, as compared to controls. As to the basal dendritic tree, there were no significant differences between the experimental and the control group. A decreased density of dendritic spines in the apical dendrite may impair the excitatory input onto pyramidal neurons, thus resulting in a widespread alteration of the cortical information flow. "

Objectives This study investigated the role of \{NSE\} as a prognostic marker of outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in a contemporary setting. Methods A total of 686 patients hospitalized after \{OHCA\} were randomized to targeted temperature management at either 33°C or 36°C. \{NSE\} levels were assessed in blood samples obtained 24, 48, and 72 h after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was neurological outcome at 6 months using the cerebral performance category score. Results \{NSE\} was a robust predictor of neurological outcome in a baseline variable-adjusted model, and target temperature did not significantly affect \{NSE\} values. Median \{NSE\} values were 18 ng/ml versus 35 ng/ml, 15 ng/ml versus 61 ng/ml, and 12 ng/ml versus 54 ng/ml for good versus poor outcome at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). At 48 and 72 h, \{NSE\} predicted neurological outcome with areas under the receiver-operating curve of 0.85 and 0.86, respectively. High \{NSE\} cutoff values with false positive rates ≤5% and tight 95% confidence intervals were able to reliably predict outcome. Conclusions High, serial \{NSE\} values are strong predictors of poor outcome after OHCA. Targeted temperature management at 33°C or 36°C does not significantly affect \{NSE\} levels.

The underlying mechanisms of \{CMS\} neuropathology are not well understood and no ideal treatment is available to prevent or cure CMS, except for phlebotomy. In the current study, we reprogrammed fibroblast cells from both \{CMS\} and non-CMS subjects’ skin biopsies into the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), then differentiated into neurons and compared their neuronal properties. We discovered that \{CMS\} neurons were much less excitable (higher rheobase) than non-CMS neurons. This decreased excitability was not caused by differences in passive neuronal properties, but instead by a significantly lowered Na+ channel current density and by a shift of the voltage-conductance curve in the depolarization direction. Our findings provide, for the first time, evidence of a neuronal abnormality in \{CMS\} subjects as compared to non-CMS subjects, hoping that such studies can pave the way to a better understanding of the neuropathology in CMS.

After 15 min of baseline recording from pyramidal neuron within the \{CA1\} region of the dorsal hippocampus, i.c.v. injection of orexin-A 0.5 nmol, \{SB334867\} 400 nmol, a selective orexin receptor 1 antagonist, saline, or DMSO, or microinjection of carbachol 250 nmol or saline into the ipsilateral lateral hypothalamus were performed using a Hamilton microsyringe, and the spontaneous firing activity continued to be recorded for 25 min. Results showed that orexin administration into the lateral cerebral ventricle excited 6 out of 8 neurons and inhibited 1 neuron. Chemical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus by carbachol excited 9 out of 13 hippocampal neurons and inhibited 3 neurons. On the other hand, i.c.v. injection of the SB334867, caused reductions in the firing activity of 6 out of 10 neurons and increases in 4 additional neurons. It seems that orexin neurotransmission in the hippocampus mostly elicits an excitatory response, whereas blockade of orexin receptor has an inhibitory effect.

In vivo immunohistochemistry demonstrated a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine increased \{ADNP\} in the somatosensory cortex (SCC) which was previously identified to be damaged by repeated exposure to anesthetic doses of ketamine. Administration of low-dose ketamine prior to full sedation prevented caspase-3 activation in the hippocampus and SCC. Primary cultures of cortical neurons treated with ketamine (10 μM–10 mM) at 3 days-in vitro (3 DIV) displayed a concentration-dependent decrease in expanded growth cones. Furthermore, neuronal production and localization of \{ADNP\} varied as a function of both ketamine concentration and length of exposure. Taken together, these data support the model that \{ADNP\} induction may be partially responsible for the efficacy of a low-dose ketamine pre-treatment in preventing ketamine-induced neuronal cell death.

After prolonged exposure to 0.1–1 μg/L of CdTe QDs, abnormal foraging behavior and deficits in development of \{RMEs\} motor neurons were observed. The observed neurotoxicity from CdTe \{QDs\} on \{RMEs\} motor neurons might be not due to released Cd2+. Overexpression of genes encoding Mn-SODs or unc-30 gene controlling cell identity of \{RMEs\} neurons prevented neurotoxic effects of CdTe \{QDs\} on \{RMEs\} motor neurons, suggesting the crucial roles of oxidative stress and cell identity in regulating CdTe \{QDs\} neurotoxicity. In nematodes, CdTe \{QDs\} could be translocated through intestinal barrier and be deposited in \{RMEs\} motor neurons. In contrast, CdTe@ZnS \{QDs\} could not be translocated into \{RMEs\} motor neurons and therefore, could only moderately accumulated in intestinal cells, suggesting that ZnS coating might reduce neurotoxicity of CdTe \{QDs\} on \{RMEs\} motor neurons. Therefore, the combinational effects of oxidative stress, cell identity, and bioavailability may contribute greatly to the mechanism of CdTe \{QDs\} neurotoxicity on \{RMEs\} motor neurons. Our results provide insights into understanding the potential risks of CdTe \{QDs\} on the development and function of nervous systems in animals. "

However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear, although changes in opioid receptor expression might be a correlative feature. Neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) functions as a crucial regulator of \{MOR\} expression in specific neuronal cells. Using a mouse model of incisional postoperative pain, we assessed the expression of \{MOR\} and \{NRSF\} and investigated whether disruption of \{NRSF\} expression could prevent the postoperative nociceptive sensitization induced by surgical incision and subcutaneous infusion of remifentanil. Methods Paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT) and paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) were independently used to assess mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia after surgery and cerebral ventricle injection of \{NRSF\} antisense oligonucleotide. Western blotting analyses were preformed to assess the expression levels of \{MOR\} and NRSF. Results \{NRSF\} expression levels were enhanced after intraoperative infusion of remifentanil, resulting in repression of \{MOR\} expression in the periaqueductal gray (PAG). \{NRSF\} blockade with an \{NRSF\} antisense oligonucleotide significantly enhanced the expression levels of \{MOR\} and alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by intraoperative infusion of remifentanil. Conclusion \{NRSF\} functions as a negative regulator of \{MOR\} in \{PAG\} and contributes to remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia. \{NRSF\} in \{PAG\} may be a potential target for this pain therapy.

Mitochondrial dysfunction involves several up/down regulation of gene products, one of which being p53 is found to be elevated. Elevated p53 is involved in mitochondrial mediated apoptosis of neuronal cells in Parkinson's patients who are folate deficient as well. The present study therefore attempts to examine the effect of Folic acid (FA) supplementation in alleviation of anomalies associated with parkin knockdown using \{RNAi\} approach, specific to Dopaminergic (DA) neurons in Drosophila model system. Here we show that \{FA\} supplementation provide protection against parkin \{RNAi\} associated discrepancies, thereby improves locomotor ability, reduces mortality and oxidative stress, and partially improves Zn levels. Further, metabolic active cell status and \{ATP\} levels were also found to be improved thereby indicating improved mitochondrial function. To corroborate \{FA\} supplementation in mitochondrial functioning further, status of p53 and spargel was checked by qRT-PCR. Here we show that folic acid supplementation enrich mitochondrial functioning as depicted from improved spargel level and lowered p53 level, which was originally vice versa in parkin knockdown flies cultured in standard media. Our data thus support the potential of folic acid in alleviating the behavioural defects, oxidative stress, augmentation of zinc and \{ATP\} levels in parkin knock down flies. Further, folic acid role in repressing mitochondrial dysfunction is encouraging to further explore its possible mechanistic role to be utilized as potential therapeutics for Parkinson's disease. "

To further clarify the role of \{LC\} noradrenergic neurons, we performed an optogenetic assay by injecting AAV-channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into the \{LC\} of cre-tyrosine hydrolase (TH) mice. We found here that the specific activation of \{LC\} noradrenergic neurons produced a significant increase in wakefulness and a significant decrease in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep during photostimulation. On the other hand, neuropathic pain is believed to significantly interfere with sleep, and inadequate sleep may contribute to the stressful negative consequences of living with pain. In the present study, sciatic nerve ligation, which produced significant thermal hyperalgesia, significantly increased the levels of noradrenaline released in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by the weak electrical stimulation of neurons in the LC. Under these conditions, the systemic administration of adrenaline α and β inhibitor cocktail at 7 days after sciatic nerve ligation restored the increased wakefulness and decreased \{NREM\} sleep to normal levels. These results suggest that neuropathic pain may accelerate neurons in the LC, and its overactivation may be, at least in part, associated with sleep disturbance under neuropathic pain. "

The aim of this study is to evaluate \{MNDys\} and \{ALS\} in a sample of consecutively enrolled sporadic \{FTLD\} patients. Methods Clinical and neurophysiological evaluations (i.e. needle electromyography) assessed lower (LMN) and upper (UMN) motor neuron function at the baseline in 70 probable \{FTLD\} patients (i.e., 26 behavioural variant-bvFTD, 20 primary progressive aphasias-PPAs and 24 corticobasal syndrome-CBS). To obtain a more accurate estimation, quantitative scales were also applied (i.e. ALSFRS-r and \{UMN\} scale). Patients were screened for MAPT, \{GRN\} and \{C9orf72\} mutations. A mean clinical follow-up of 27.8 ± 22.4 months assessed \{MNDys\} progression and the clinical presentation of ALS. Results Five genetic cases were identified. Within the sample of sporadic patients, a relative low rate of \{FTLD\} patients was diagnosed as probable \{ALS\} (5%), while a higher proportion of patients (17%) showed clinical and neurophysiological MNDys. Thirteen patients (20%) presented with isolated clinical signs of \{LMN\} and/or \{UMN\} dysfunction, and 8 patients (12%) showed neurogenic changes at the electromyography. No differences in \{FTLD\} phenotype and disease duration were found between \{MNDys\} positive and negative patients. Clinical \{MNDys\} were highly associated with positive electromyographic findings. At follow-up, no \{MNDys\} positive patient developed ALS. Conclusion Neurophysiological and clinical examinations revealed mild \{MNDys\} in \{FTLD\} patients not fulfilling criteria for ALS. This condition did not evolve at a mean follow-up of two years. These results, indicating a subclinical degeneration of corticospinal tracts and lower motor neurons, suggest that \{FTLD\} patients may be more at risk of \{MNDys\} than the general population. "

The proposed model incorporates to our widely experimentally tested model of superdiamagnetism (SD) and Ca2+ Coulomb explosion (CE) from lipid (LP) bilayer membrane (SD–CE model), the electrical quadrupolar long range interaction between the bilayer \{LP\} membranes of synchronized neuron pairs, not considered before. The quadrupolar interaction is capable of explaining well the observed synchronization. Actual extension of our SD–CE-model shows that the neuron firing frequency field, B, dependence becomes not modified, but the bioelectric frequency is decreased and its spontaneous temperature, T, dependence is modified. A comparison of the model with synchronization experimental results of pair of neurons under weak ( B 0 ≅ 0.2–15 mT) AC-MF of frequency fM=50 Hz is reported. From the deduced size of synchronized \{LP\} clusters under B, is suggested the formation of small neuron networks via the membrane lipid correlation. "

Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the rat sciatic nerve increases excitatory synaptic drive to excitatory neurons in the substantia gelatinosa while limiting that to inhibitory neurons. Since the calcium-binding protein calbindin D-28K has been associated with excitatory neurons, we examined whether \{CCI\} altered the properties of neurons expressing calbindin-like immunoreactivity (Cal+). These account for 30% of the neurons in lamina I and II. Calbindin did not co-localize with any particular electrophysiological phenotype of neuron; in substantia gelatinosa, it was found in some tonic, delay, irregular, phasic and transient firing neurons and in some cells that displayed central, radial or vertical morphology. When neuronal phenotype was defined more precisely in terms of both morphology and electrophysiological properties, no strong correlation with calbindin expression was found. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) in calbindin negative (Cal−) neurons was greater than that in Cal+ neurons. \{CCI\} did not alter the proportion of Cal+ neurons in the dorsal horn. Although \{CCI\} promoted a fourfold increase in sEPSC frequency in Cal+ neurons, sEPSC amplitude was reduced by 22% and charge transfer per second was unchanged. Since synaptic drive to Cal+ neurons is weak and there is no firm correlation between neuronal phenotype and calbindin expression, it is doubtful whether these neurons play a major role in the generation of central sensitization.

Fractal analysis has proved to be a valuable method for analyzing the complexity of dendrite morphology. The aim of this study was to establish the fractal dimension of apical dendrite arborization of pyramidal neurons in distinct neocortical laminae by using the modified box-counting method. A total of thirty, Golgi impregnated neurons from the rat brain were analyzed: 15 superficial (cell bodies located within lamina II–III), and 15 deep pyramidal neurons (cell bodies situated within lamina V–VI). Analysis of topological parameters of apical dendrite arborization showed no statistical differences except in total dendritic length (p = 0.02), indicating considerable homogeneity between the two groups of neurons. On the other hand, average fractal dimension of apical dendrite was 1.33 ± 0.06 for the superficial and 1.24 ± 0.04 for the deep cortical neurons, showing statistically significant difference between these two groups (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, according to the fractal dimension values, apical dendrites of the superficial pyramidal neurons tend to show higher structural complexity compared to the deep ones. "

The activation and neurochemical phenotype of \{SPN\} innervating the adrenal glands and celiac ganglia were determined using the retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit, in combination with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Blood glucose was elevated at multiple time points following \{HDZ\} administration but little evidence of chromaffin cell activation was seen suggesting non-adrenal mechanisms contribute to the sustained hyperglycemia. 16±0.1% of T4-T11 \{SPN\} contained c-Fos and of these: 24.3±1.4% projected to adrenal glands and 29±5.5% projected to celiac ganglia with the rest innervating other targets. 62.8±1.4% of \{SPN\} innervating adrenal glands were activated and 29.9±3.3% expressed \{PPE\} mRNA whereas 53.2±8.6% of \{SPN\} innervating celiac ganglia were activated and 31.2±8.8% expressed \{PPE\} mRNA.

While progress has been made in understanding the contributions and characteristics of \{CRF\} as a neuropeptide in rodent behavior, little attention has been committed to determine the properties and synaptic physiology of specific populations of CRF-expressing (CRF+) and non-expressing (CRF−) neurons in the CeA and BnST. Here, we fill this gap by electrophysiologically characterizing distinct neuronal subtypes in CeA and BnST. Crossing tdTomato or channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2-YFP) reporter mice to those expressing Cre-recombinase under the \{CRF\} promoter allowed us to identify and manipulate CRF+ and CRF− neurons in CeA and BnST, the two largest areas with fluorescently labeled neurons in these mice. We optogenetically activated CRF+ neurons to elicit action potentials or synaptic responses in CRF+ and CRF− neurons. We found that \{GABA\} is the predominant co-transmitter in CRF+ neurons within the CeA and BnST. CRF+ neurons are highly interconnected with CRF− neurons and to a lesser extent with CRF+ neurons. CRF+ and CRF− neurons differentially express tonic \{GABA\} currents. Chronic, unpredictable stress increase the amplitude of evoked \{IPSCs\} and connectivity between CRF+ neurons, but not between CRF+ and CRF− neurons in both regions.

Previously, we showed that the loss of \{ENS\} neurons in animal models such as tri-nitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis was a limited and early event despite progressive worsening of inflammation. Here, we demonstrated that the rapid appearance of activated immune cells in the intestinal wall is selectively neurotoxic via iNOS-derived NO, using TNBS-induced colitis in both rats and mice, and a co-culture model of \{ENS\} neurons and smooth muscle. An influx of neutrophils and macrophages occurred within hours of initiation of rat colitis, correlating with iNOS expression, acutely elevated \{NO\} and neuronal death. In vitro, chemical donors of \{NO\} selectively caused axonal damage and neuronal death. These outcomes were similar to those seen with combined culture with either activated peritoneal immune cells or the immune cell lines RAW-264 and RBL-2H3. Immune cell-mediated neurotoxicity was blocked by the iNOS inhibitor L-NIL, and neuronal death was inhibited by the RIP-1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin. In a mouse model, the stereotypic loss of myenteric neurons by Day 4 post-TNBS was abrogated by the selective iNOS inhibitors L-NIL or 1400W without effect on other parameters of intestinal inflammation. Preservation of \{ENS\} neurons also ameliorated the hyperplasia of smooth muscle that is characteristic of intestinal inflammation, in line with prior work showing neural regulation of smooth muscle phenotype. This identifies a predominant pathway of immune cell damage to the ENS, where early, acute elevation of \{NO\} from iNOS can be cytotoxic to myenteric neurons. "

The sole Caenorhabditis elegans \{RFX\} homolog, DAF-19, plays at least two roles in the formation of functional cilia. The DAF-19C isoform is required for ciliogenesis and the DAF-19M isoform is required for the functional specialization of a subset of male-specific ciliated neurons called \{PKD\} neurons. Here we report the identification of a novel mutation, daf-19(sm129), which disrupts the functional specification of \{PKD\} neurons and thus suggests that daf-19m activity is compromised. However, ciliogenesis is not disrupted in daf-19(sm129) mutants suggesting that daf-19c activity is retained. The sm129 mutation disrupts a splice acceptor site adjacent to an exon common to the daf-19c and daf-19m isoforms resulting in aberrant splicing in a proportion of transcripts. While aberrant splicing of daf-19c to upstream cryptic sites results in in-frame and functional products, a large proportion of daf-19m mRNAs include the entire upstream intron, which introduces a frameshift and stop codons. At least 15% of disease-causing mutations affect splicing of the gene bearing the mutation, thus it is important to understand the consequences of splice site mutations on gene function. However, predicting the effects of a splice site mutation remains difficult and experimental determination is still required. Using daf-19(sm129) as a model, our results suggest that this problem is exacerbated when a splice acceptor mutation is used by multiple isoforms of the same gene because the effects on each isoform can be dramatically different.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential regulation of \{BK\} channel activities by \{PAR2\} activation in vagal bronchopulmonary sensory neurons. Our results showed that pretreatment with PAR2-activating peptide (PAR2-AP; 100 μM, 120 s), but not its control peptide PAR2-RP, significantly reduced \{BK\} current density in these neurons. Inhibition of phospholipase C, PKC, \{PKA\} or MEK/ERK signaling pathway did not prevent the suppression of \{BK\} current by \{PAR2\} activation; whereas intracellular application of Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM completely abolished the \{PAR2\} regulation of \{BK\} current. In addition, our results demonstrated that activation of \{PAR2\} increased excitability of bronchopulmonary sensory neurons, in a similar manner as displayed by a direct \{BK\} channel blockade.

Fibroblasts that were cultured on flat, microgrooved, and nanogrooved substrates responded differently to the patterned substrates in terms of cell alignment. Subsequently, the \{DA\} marker expressions, acquisition of mature \{DA\} neuronal phenotypes, and the conversion efficiency were enhanced mostly on the nanogrooved substrate. These results may be attributed to specific histone modifications and transcriptional changes associated with mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition.

This paper describes an in vitro study that explores the neuronal responses to oxidative stress focusing on changes in neuronal excitability and functional membrane properties. This study was carried out in pyramidal cells of the motor cortex by applying whole-cell patch-clamp techniques on brain slices from young adult rats. Oxygen-derived free radical formation was induced by bath application of 10 μM cumene hydroperoxide (CH) for 30 min. \{CH\} produced marked changes in the electrophysiological properties of neurons (n = 30). Resting membrane potential became progressively depolarized, as well as depolarization voltage, with no variations in voltage threshold. Membrane resistance showed a biphasic behavior, increasing after 5 min of drug exposure and then it started to decrease, even under control values, after 15 and 30 min. At the same time, changes in membrane resistance produced compensatory variations in the rheobase. The amplitude of the action potentials diminished and the duration increased progressively over time. Some of the neurons under study also lost their ability to discharge action potentials in a repetitive way. Most of the neurons, however, kept their repetitive discharge even though their maximum frequency and gain decreased. Furthermore, cancelation of the repetitive firing discharge took place at intensities that decreased with time of exposure to CH, which resulted in a narrower working range. We can conclude that oxidative stress compromises both neuronal excitability and the capability of generating action potentials, and so this type of neuronal functional failure could precede the neuronal death characteristics of many neurodegenerative diseases.

In transgenic mice expressing glucagon promoter-driven yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), these brainstem \{PPG\} neurons project to many central autonomic regions where GLP-1 receptors are expressed. The spinal cord also contains GLP-1 receptor mRNA but the distribution of spinal \{PPG\} axons is unknown. Here, we used two-color immunoperoxidase labeling to examine \{PPG\} innervation of spinal segments T1–S4 in YFP-PPG mice. Immunoreactivity for \{YFP\} identified spinal \{PPG\} axons and perikarya. We classified spinal neurons receiving \{PPG\} input by immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and/or Fluorogold (FG) retrogradely transported from the peritoneal cavity. \{FG\} microinjected at \{T9\} defined cell bodies that supplied spinal \{PPG\} innervation. The deep dorsal horn of lower lumbar cord contained YFP-immunoreactive neurons. Non-varicose, YFP-immunoreactive axons were prominent in the lateral funiculus, ventral white commissure and around the ventral median fissure. In T1–L2, varicose, YFP-containing axons closely apposed many ChAT-immunoreactive sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) in the intermediolateral cell column (IML) and dorsal lamina X. In the sacral parasympathetic nucleus, about 10% of ChAT-immunoreactive preganglionic neurons received \{YFP\} appositions, as did occasional ChAT-positive motor neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the ventral horn. \{YFP\} appositions also occurred on NOS-immunoreactive spinal interneurons and on spinal YFP-immunoreactive neurons. Injecting \{FG\} at \{T9\} retrogradely labeled many YFP-PPG cell bodies in the medulla but none of the spinal YFP-immunoreactive neurons.

Comparison with existing methods Our results are slightly lower than those of previous studies but when differences in counting cells is taken into account, a comparison of results is really difficult. Conclusions These new differentiation cocktails should be further investigated and in the next experiment only a part of \{MSCs\} that expressed the Cxcr4 receptor will be differentiated. We suppose that the Cxcr4(+) cells may differentiate more easily and as a result, we may achieve a homogenous population of one phenotype of neurons. "

To elucidate the mechanism regulating cell-specific gene expression in a highly specialized cell, \{AFD\} thermosensory neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans, we analyzed the promoter sequences of guanylyl cyclase genes, gcy-8 and gcy-18, exclusively expressed in AFD. In this study, we showed that AFD-specific expression of gcy-8 and gcy-18 requires the co-expression of homeodomain proteins, CEH-14/LHX3 and TTX-1/OTX1. We observed that mutation of ttx-1 or ceh-14 caused a reduction in the expression of gcy-8 and gcy-18 and that the expression was completely lost in double mutants. This synergy effect was also observed with other \{AFD\} marker genes, such as ntc-1, nlp-21and cng-3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed direct interaction of CEH-14 and TTX-1 proteins with gcy-8 and gcy-18 promoters in vitro. The binding sites of CEH-14 and TTX-1 proteins were confirmed to be essential for AFD-specific expression of gcy-8 and gcy-18 in vivo. We also demonstrated that forced expression of CEH-14 and TTX-1 in \{AWB\} chemosensory neurons induced ectopic expression of gcy-8 and gcy-18 reporters in this neuron. Finally, we showed that the regulation of gcy-8 and gcy-18 expression by ceh-14 and ttx-1 is evolutionally conserved in five Caenorhabditis species. Taken together, ceh-14 and ttx-1 expression determines the fate of \{AFD\} as terminal selector genes at the final step of cell specification. "

All experiments were performed under blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Co-application of \{NMDA\} and d-serine decreased the tractus solitarius (TS)-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) in 7/12 (58%) of neurons, and increased the paired pulse ratio. The remaining neurons were insensitive to \{NMDA\} and d-serine. Application of an \{NMDA\} antagonist D-AP5 had no effect on eEPSCs in all 8 neurons tested. Action potential-independent \{EPSCs\} (miniature EPSCs; mEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin. Co-application of \{NMDA\} and d-serine increased the mEPSC frequency but had no significant effect on the amplitude in 5/28 (18%) of neurons. D-AP5 decreased the mEPSC frequency without effect on the amplitude in 6/18 (33%) of neurons. This study demonstrated that (1) \{NMDA\} receptors were presynaptically distributed in a subset of \{NTS\} second-order neurons and that (2) the presynaptic \{NMDA\} receptors played an inhibitory role in TS-mediated release of glutamate and a facilitatory role in spontaneous release of glutamate.

Although nanoparticles can enter the brain, little is known so far on the uptake of \{IONPs\} in neurons and on their neurotoxic potential. Hence, we applied dimercaptosuccinate (DMSA)-coated \{IONPs\} to cultured primary rat cerebellar granule neurons. These \{IONPs\} had average hydrodynamic diameters of around 80 nm and 120 nm when dispersed in incubation medium in the absence and the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Acute exposure of neurons with \{IONPs\} for up to 6 h did neither alter the cell morphology nor compromise cell viability, although neurons accumulated large amounts of \{IONPs\} in a time- and concentration-dependent manner which caused delayed toxicity. For the first 30 min of incubation of neurons at 37 °C with \{IONPs\} the cellular iron content increased proportionally to the concentration of \{IONPs\} applied irrespective of the absence and the presence of serum. IONP-exposure in the absence of serum generated maximal cellular iron contents of around 3000 nmol iron/mg protein after 4 h of incubation, while the accumulation in the presence of 10% serum was slower and reached already within 1 h maximal values of around 450 nmol iron/mg protein. For both incubation conditions was the increase in cellular iron contents significantly lowered by reducing the incubation temperature to 4 °C. Application of inhibitors of endocytotic pathways did not affect neuronal \{IONP\} accumulation in the absence of serum, while inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis lowered significantly the \{IONP\} accumulation in the presence of serum. These data demonstrate that DMSA-coated \{IONPs\} are not acutely toxic to cultured neurons and that a protein corona around the particles strongly affects their interaction with neurons. "

Building on this evidence and our recent study showing that the inflammatory chemokine, CCL2, stimulates the migration of hypothalamic neurons and expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, we tested here the possibility that prenatal exposure to a \{HFD\} in rats affects this chemokine system, both \{CCL2\} and its receptors, \{CCR2\} and CCR4, and alters its actions on hypothalamic neurons, specifically those expressing the neuropeptides, enkephalin (ENK) and galanin (GAL). Using primary dissociated hypothalamic neurons extracted from embryos on embryonic day 19, we found that prenatal \{HFD\} exposure compared to chow control actually reduces the expression of \{CCL2\} in these hypothalamic neurons, while increasing \{CCR2\} and \{CCR4\} expression, and also reduces the sensitivity of hypothalamic neurons to CCL2. The \{HFD\} abolished the dose-dependent, stimulatory effect of \{CCL2\} on the number of migrated neurons and even shifted its normal stimulatory effect on migrational velocity and distance traveled by control neurons to an inhibition of migration. Further, it abolished the dose-dependent, stimulatory effect of \{CCL2\} on neuronal expression of \{ENK\} and GAL. These results demonstrate that prenatal \{HFD\} exposure greatly disturbs the functioning of the \{CCL2\} chemokine system in embryonic hypothalamic neurons, reducing its endogenous levels and ability to promote the migration of neurons and their expression of orexigenic peptides.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to assess whether both types of gestures activate the human mirror-neuron system (hMNS). Low-visuospatial-ability learners benefited from corresponding gestures only, whereas high-visuospatial-ability learners achieved good results with both types of gestures. Accordingly, only low-visuospatial-ability learners showed higher activation of the inferior-frontal cortex (part of the hMNS) for corresponding than for non-corresponding gestures. Furthermore, low-visuospatial-ability learners watching non-corresponding gestures yielded better results when their inferior-parietal cortex (another part of the hMNS) was activated. Thus, three factors predict positive learning outcomes: higher visuospatial abilities, inferior-frontal cortex activation, and inferior-parietal cortex activation. In sum, activating the hMNS seems to facilitate learning about biological movements, and stimulating the hMNS by means of corresponding gestures might be an adequate instructional strategy to support low-visuospatial-ability learners.

Mechanisms underlying rotenone neurotoxicity are still being defined. Our recent studies suggest that rotenone-induced dopamine neuron death involves microtubule destabilization, which leads to accumulation of cytosolic dopamine and consequently reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is required for rotenone-induced dopamine neuron death. Here we report that the neural specific \{JNK3\} isoform of the JNKs, but not \{JNK1\} or JNK2, is responsible for this neuron death in primary cultured dopamine neurons. Treatment with taxol, a microtubule stabilizing agent, attenuates rotenone-induced phosphorylation and presumably activation of JNK. This suggests that \{JNK\} is activated by microtubule destabilization upon rotenone exposure. Moreover, rotenone inhibits \{VMAT2\} activity but not \{VMAT2\} protein levels. Significantly, treatment with SP600125, a pharmacological inhibitor of JNKs, attenuates rotenone inhibition of VMAT2. Furthermore, decreased \{VMAT2\} activity following in vitro incubation of recombinant \{JNK3\} protein with purified mesencephalic synaptic vesicles suggests that \{JNK3\} can inhibit \{VMAT2\} activity. Together with our previous findings, these results suggest that rotenone induces dopamine neuron death through a series of sequential events including microtubule destabilization, \{JNK3\} activation, \{VMAT2\} inhibition, accumulation of cytosolic dopamine, and generation of ROS. Our data identify \{JNK3\} as a novel regulator of \{VMAT2\} activity. "

We have recently characterized calretinin-expressing (CR+) neurons in the \{DH\} and shown that they can be divided into excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations. The excitatory population receives high-frequency excitatory synaptic input and expresses delayed firing action potential discharge, whereas the inhibitory population receives weak excitatory drive and exhibits tonic or initial bursting discharge. Here, we characterize inhibitory synaptic input and neuromodulation in the two CR+ populations, in order to determine how each is regulated. We show that excitatory CR+ neurons receive mixed inhibition from \{GABAergic\} and glycinergic sources, whereas inhibitory CR+ neurons receive inhibition, which is dominated by glycine. Noradrenaline and serotonin produced robust outward currents in excitatory CR+ neurons, predicting an inhibitory action on these neurons, but neither neuromodulator produced a response in CR+ inhibitory neurons. In contrast, enkephalin (along with selective mu and delta opioid receptor agonists) produced outward currents in inhibitory CR+ neurons, consistent with an inhibitory action but did not affect the excitatory CR+ population. Our findings show that the pharmacology of inhibitory inputs and neuromodulator actions on CR+ cells, along with their excitatory inputs can define these two subpopulations further, and this could be exploited to modulate discrete aspects of sensory processing selectively in the DH.

We show that \{SLC38A8\} has preference for transporting l-glutamine, l-alanine, l-arginine, l-histidine and l-aspartate using a Na+-dependent transport mechanism and that the functional characteristics of \{SNAT8\} have highest similarity to the known System A transporters. We also provide a comprehensive central nervous system expression profile in mouse brain for the Slc38a8 gene and the \{SNAT8\} protein. We show that Slc38a8 (SNAT8) is expressed in all neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, in mouse brain using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, proximity ligation assay shows highly similar subcellular expression of \{SNAT7\} and SNAT8. In conclusion, the neuronal \{SLC38A8\} has a broad amino acid transport profile and is the first identified neuronal System A transporter.

Methods hiPS cells were seeded on a Matrigel-coated dish and cultured to induce differentiation into a dopamine neuronal linage. On day 18 of culture, cells were collected from the culture dishes and seeded into U-bottom 96-well plates to induce cell aggregate formation. After 5 days, cell aggregates were collected from the plates and microencapsulated in agarose microbeads. The microencapsulated aggregates were cultured for an additional 45 days to induce maturation of dopamine neurons. Results Approximately 60% of all cells differentiated into tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in agarose microbeads. The cells released dopamine for more than 40 days. In addition, microbeads containing cells could be cryopreserved. Conclusion hiPS cells were successfully differentiated into dopamine neurons in agarose microbeads. General significance Agarose microencapsulation provides a good supporting environment for the preparation and storage of dopamine neurons. "

Automatic methods are able to eliminate this timing gap, but the state-of-the-art accuracy so far is insufficient for use without user corrections. If completed naively, this process of correction can be tedious and time consuming. New method We present a new semi-automatic method that can be used to perform 3D segmentation of neurites in \{EM\} image stacks. It utilizes an automatic method that creates a hierarchical structure for recommended merges of superpixels. The user is then guided through each predicted region to quickly identify errors and establish correct links. Results We tested our method on three datasets with both novice and expert users. Accuracy and timing were compared with published automatic, semi-automatic, and manual results. Comparison with existing methods Post-automatic correction methods have also been used in Mishchenko et al. (2010) and Haehn et al. (2014). These methods do not provide navigation or suggestions in the manner we present. Other semi-automatic methods require user input prior to the automatic segmentation such as Jeong et al. (2009) and Cardona et al. (2010) and are inherently different than our method. Conclusion Using this method on the three datasets, novice users achieved accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art automatic results, and expert users achieved accuracy on par with full manual labeling but with a 70% time improvement when compared with other examples in publication.

In this paper, a novel method is presented to improve PBSNLR׳s efficiency without reducing its accuracy, and this method is applied to solve user authentication problem in real time. In our method, a user׳s behavioral biometric of sliding dynamic and finger pressure are selected as spatiotemporal features to recognize the user׳s identity. The temporal feature is obtained by the time coding of \{SNNs\} and the spatial feature is represented by the neurons׳ relative positions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our improved algorithm outperforms the traditional \{PBSNLR\} in terms of efficiency and exhibits excellent performance when identifying users of touch screen devices.

Whether this circuit takes place only in mature granule neurons or, on the contrary, whether immature granule neurons also contribute to this novel connection is unknown. We used various retroviral vectors to show that immature granule neurons send axonal processes to and establish synaptic contacts with \{CA2\} pyramidal neurons and that axonal growth follows a similar time course to that described for \{CA3\} innervation.

Frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease is now recognised as an important dementia syndrome, which presents substantial challenges for diagnosis and management. Frontotemporal dementia, motor neuron disease, and frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease are characterised by overlapping patterns of \{TAR\} \{DNA\} binding protein (TDP-43) pathology, while the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) repeat expansion is common across the disease spectrum. Indeed, the \{C9orf72\} repeat expansion provides important clues to disease pathogenesis and suggests potential therapeutic targets. Variable diagnostic criteria identify motor, cognitive, and behavioural deficits, but further refinement is needed to define the clinical syndromes encountered in frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease.

Methods iPSC lines from patients with two distinct forms of axonal \{CMT\} (CMT2A and CMT2E) were differentiated into spinal cord motor neurons and used to study axonal structure and function and electrophysiological properties in vitro. Results iPSC-derived motor neurons exhibited gene and protein expression, ultrastructural and electrophysiological features of mature primary spinal cord motor neurons. Cytoskeletal abnormalities were found in neurons from a \{CMT2E\} (NEFL) patient and corroborated by a mouse model of the same \{NEFL\} point mutation. Abnormalities in mitochondrial trafficking were found in neurons derived from this patient, but were only mildly present in neurons from a \{CMT2A\} (MFN2) patient. Novel electrophysiological abnormalities, including reduced action potential threshold and abnormal channel current properties were observed in motor neurons derived from both of these patients. Interpretation Human iPSC-derived motor neurons from axonal \{CMT\} patients replicated key pathophysiological features observed in other models of \{MFN2\} and \{NEFL\} mutations, including abnormal cytoskeletal and mitochondrial dynamics. Electrophysiological abnormalities found in axonal \{CMT\} iPSC-derived human motor neurons suggest that these cells are hyperexcitable and have altered sodium and calcium channel kinetics.

Hypothalamic neuronal functions are modulated by glial cells; these form an extensive network connecting the neurons and cerebral vasculature, known as the neurovascular unit (NVU). Brain pericytes are periendothelial accessory structures of the blood–brain barrier and integral members of the NVU. However, the interaction between pericytes and neurons is largely unexplored. Here, we investigate whether brain pericytes could affect hypothalamic neuronal insulin signaling. Our immunohistochemical observations demonstrated the existence of pericytes in the mouse hypothalamus, exhibiting immunoreactivity of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (a pericyte marker), and laminin, a basal lamina marker. We then exposed a murine hypothalamic neuronal cell line, GT1-7, to conditioned medium obtained from primary cultures of rat brain pericytes. Pericyte-conditioned medium (PCM), but not astrocyte- or aortic smooth muscle cell-conditioned medium, increased the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in GT1-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. \{PCM\} also enhanced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor β without changing its expression or localization in cytosolic or plasma membrane fractions. These results suggest that pericytes, rather than astrocytes, increase insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neurons by releasing soluble factors under physiological conditions in the NVU. "

Its function is to transport dopamine from the extracellular space into the presynaptic neuron. Studies have suggested that accumulation of dopamine in the cytosol can trigger oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Previously, ectopic expression of the dopamine transporter was shown to cause damage in non-dopaminergic neurons due to their inability to handle cytosolic dopamine. However, it is unknown whether increasing dopamine transporter activity will be detrimental to dopamine neurons that are inherently capable of storing and degrading dopamine. To address this issue, we characterized transgenic mice that over-express the dopamine transporter selectively in dopamine neurons. We report that dopamine transporter over-expressing (DAT-tg) mice display spontaneous loss of midbrain dopamine neurons that is accompanied by increases in oxidative stress markers, 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine and 5-S-cysteinyl-DOPAC. In addition, metabolite-to-dopamine ratios are increased and \{VMAT2\} protein expression is decreased in the striatum of these animals. Furthermore, DAT-tg mice also show fine motor deficits on challenging beam traversal that are reversed with l-DOPA treatment. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that even in neurons that routinely handle dopamine, increased uptake of this neurotransmitter through the dopamine transporter results in oxidative damage, neuronal loss and l-DOPA reversible motor deficits. In addition, \{DAT\} over-expressing animals are highly sensitive to MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. The effects of increased dopamine uptake in these transgenic mice could shed light on the unique vulnerability of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease. "

Immunostaining for the \{CB2\} receptor was found in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, a fact confirmed with double-staining analyses. The signal was found in controls but also in \{PD\} patients, in which \{CB2\} receptor labelling was significantly lower, in parallel to the losses of these neurons experienced in the disease.

We previously identified difficulty with motor unit recruitment in patients as a novel contributor to ICUAW. To study the mechanism underlying poor recruitment of motor units we used the rat cecal ligation and puncture model of sepsis. We identified striking dysfunction of alpha motor neurons during repetitive firing. Firing was more erratic, and often intermittent. Our data raised the possibility that reduced excitability of motor neurons was a significant contributor to weakness induced by sepsis. In this study we quantified the contribution of reduced motor neuron excitability and compared its magnitude to the contributions of myopathy, neuropathy and failure of neuromuscular transmission. We injected constant depolarizing current pulses (5 s) into the soma of alpha motor neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord of anesthetized rats to trigger repetitive firing. In response to constant depolarization, motor neurons in untreated control rats fired at steady and continuous firing rates and generated smooth and sustained tetanic motor unit force as expected. In contrast, following induction of sepsis, motor neurons were often unable to sustain firing throughout the 5 s current injection such that force production was reduced. Even when firing, motor neurons from septic rats fired erratically and discontinuously, leading to irregular production of motor unit force. Both fast and slow type motor neurons had similar disruption of excitability. We followed rats after recovery from sepsis to determine the time course of resolution of the defect in motor neuron excitability. By one week, rats appeared to have recovered from sepsis as they had no piloerection and appeared to be in no distress. The defects in motor neuron repetitive firing were still striking at 2 weeks and, although improved, were present at one month. We infer that rats suffered from weakness due to reduced motor neuron excitability for weeks after resolution of sepsis. To assess whether additional contributions from myopathy, neuropathy and defects in neuromuscular transmission contributed to the reduction in force generation, we measured whole-muscle force production in response to electrical stimulation of the muscle nerve. We found no abnormality in force generation that would suggest the presence of myopathy, neuropathy or defective neuromuscular transmission. These data suggest disruption of repetitive firing of motor neurons is an important contributor to weakness induced by sepsis in rats and raise the possibility that reduced motor neuron excitability contributes to disability that persists after resolution of sepsis.

abstract = "Background Elevated serum levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was initially assumed to be specific to neuronal tumors (particularly neuroblastoma), but is now known to accompany nontumoral conditions and tumors other than neuroblastomas. There is a need to establish normal ranges for NSE, especially in early infancy. The aims of this study were to determine reference values for \{NSE\} in newborns and young infants and to assess whether \{NSE\} levels in early infancy (i.e., preterm infants and term infants) differ from the adult reference range for this enzyme. Methods We enrolled 140 healthy babies, which included 40 preterm newborns (3–15 days old and born at 28–42 weeks gestation), 40 term newborns (&lt; 1 month old and born at term), and 60 young infants 1–3 months old (n = 20 per subgroup of 1-, 2-, and 3-month-old infants). The determination of \{NSE\} levels was performed by the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method using the Elecysys 2010 device (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The mean serum \{NSE\} levels for the preterm newborns was 21.83 ± 15.06 ng/mL [95% confidence interval (95%CI), 16.95–26.71 ng/mL]; term newborns, 18.06 ± 12.83 ng/mL (95%CI, 13.94–22.19 ng/mL); and young infants, 9.09 ± 4.38 ng/mL (95%CI, 7.96–10.23 ng/mL). The mean serum \{NSE\} level for infants 1–3 months old was within the \{ECLIA\} kit's normal range (4.7–18 ng/mL for adults), whereas the corresponding means for the preterm and term newborns were higher (p &lt; 0.001, for both). Conclusion Our findings suggest that adult reference values should not be applied to the preterm and term age groups. "

In primary hippocampal neuronal culture, we observed that dopamine \{D2\} receptors (D2R) co-localized with certain subtypes of \{GABAA\} receptors, namely α1, β3, and γ2 subunits, as revealed by double immunofluorocytochemical analysis. Treatment with the \{D2R\} agonist, quinpirole, was shown to elicit an increase in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in hippocampal neurons. This phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreatment with the \{GABAA\} receptor agonist, muscimol. Furthermore, treatment of hippocampal neurons with quinpirole increased the dendritic spine density and this regulation was totally blocked by pretreatment with a \{MAP\} kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor (PD98059), \{D2R\} antagonist (haloperidol), or by the \{GABAA\} receptor agonist, muscimol. These results suggest that D2R-mediated \{ERK\} phosphorylation can control spine formation and that the \{GABAA\} receptor negatively regulates the D2R-induced spine formation through \{ERK\} signaling in hippocampal neurons, thus indicating a potential role of \{D2R\} in the control of hippocampal neuronal excitability.

Since these accumulations potentially contribute to neuronal cell death associated with the disease, we investigated two pharmacological strategies which potentially reduce the number of autophagic structures under following aspects: efficiency, sustainability and effect on neuronal cell viability. The strategies comprised (i) an interruption of the autophagic flux by the class \{III\} \{PI3K\} inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and (ii) an acceleration of the autophagic execution by 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (pCD). Our data show that the inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA only initially reduced the number of autophagic vacuoles in cultured neurons. Prolonged treatments with the PI3K-inhibitor reversed this lowering effect. The re-increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles was combined with a defect in the integrity of lysosomes which endangered further survival of cells. The treatment with pCD evoked a slow but sustained reduction of autophagic structures and had no negative effects on neuronal survival. "

Amyloid-beta oligomers (AβOs), the primary neurotoxin implicated in AD, downregulate insulin signaling by impairing protein kinase B/AKT, thereby overactivating glycogen synthase kinase-3β. By this mechanism, AβOs may also impair axonal transport before tau-induced cytoskeletal collapse and cell death. Here, we demonstrate that a constitutively active form of protein kinase B/AKT prevents brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transport defects in AβO-treated primary neurons from wild type (tau+/+) and tau knockout (tau−/−) mice. Remarkably, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β rescues \{BDNF\} transport defects independent of tau. Furthermore, exendin-4, an anti-diabetes agent, restores normal \{BDNF\} axonal transport by stimulating the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor to activate the insulin pathway. Collectively, our findings indicate that normalized insulin signaling can both prevent and reverse \{BDNF\} transport defects in AβO-treated neurons. Ultimately, this work may reveal novel therapeutic targets that regulate \{BDNF\} trafficking, promote its secretion and uptake, and prolong neuronal survival during \{AD\} progression. "

This requires a general purpose sensorimotor mechanism that transforms an external fixation-point (partner’s shoulder) reference frame to one’s own body-centered reference frame. We propose that the mechanism of gain-modulation observed in parietal neurons may generally serve these types of transformations by binding the sensory signals across the modalities with radial basis functions (tensor products) on the one hand and by permitting the learning of contextual reference frames on the other hand. In a shoulder–elbow robotic experiment, gain-field neurons (GF) intertwine the visuo-motor variables so that their amplitude depends on them all. In situations of modification of the body-centered reference frame, the error detected in the visuo-motor mapping can serve then to learn the transformation between the robot’s current sensorimotor space and the new one. These situations occur for instance when we turn the head on its axis (visual transformation), when we use a tool (body modification), or when we interact with a partner (embodied simulation). Our results defend the idea that the biologically-inspired mechanism of gain modulation found in parietal neurons can serve as a basic structure for achieving nonlinear mapping in spatial tasks as well as in cooperative and social functions.

Two main modulatory transmitters regulate the output of these neurons: dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh). dSPNs express D1-type DA, M1-and M4-type \{ACh\} receptors, while iSPNs express D2-type \{DA\} and M1-type \{ACh\} receptors. Actions of M1-, D1-, and D2-receptors have been extensively reported, but we still ignore most actions of muscarinic M4-type receptors. Here, we used whole-cell recordings in acutely dissociated neurons, pharmacological tools such as mamba-toxins, and \{BAC\} \{D1\} or 2-eGFP transgenic mice to show that activation of M4-type receptors with bath applied muscarine enhances Ca2+-currents through CaV1-channels in dSPNs and not in iSPNs. This action increases excitability of dSPNs after both direct current injection and synaptically driven stimulation. The increases in Ca2+-current and excitability were blocked specifically by mamba toxin-3, suggesting mediation via M4-type receptors. M4-receptor activation also increased network activity of dSPNs but not of iSPNs as seen with calcium-imaging techniques. Moreover, actions of D1-type and M4-type receptors may add to produce a larger enhancement of excitability of dSPNs or, paradoxically, oppose each other depending on the order of their activation. Possible implications of these findings are discussed. "

In this study, increasing the concentration of \{CO2\} in the air caused hyperventilation and enlargement of the pneumostome in the intact animal. In a semi-intact preparation, pouring artificial seawater (ASW) with dissolved \{CO2\} onto the central ganglia caused the previously closed pneumostome to open. In an \{ASW\} environment, Ip-1/2 neurons depolarized even under conditions of constant pH (alkaline ASW) and after dissolution of CO2. This depolarization prolonged the firing of action potentials in Ip-1/2 neurons. Adding protons (H+) to \{ASW\} caused Ip-1/2 depolarization only when the neurons' membranes were depolarized to a potential above the resting potential. Furthermore, in the presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (AZ), CO2-induced excitation in Ip-1/2 neurons was increased in both normal and alkaline ASW. These results suggest that when dissolved in ASW, \{CO2\} directly induced the depolarizing response in Ip-1/2 neurons. Since Ip-1/2 neurons participate in pneumostome opening, these results suggest that increased \{CO2\} levels in \{ASW\} directly stimulate CO2-sensitive central neurons, promoting ventilation. "

The ability to collect sub-cellular molecular images in minutes has opened the door to a new era of biochemical studies. Although a multi-beam approach is the superior method to this form of imaging, it requires a specialized set of beamline optics, which may not be compatible with existing mid-infrared microscopy beamlines, or research programs/applications currently in place (some of which do not require an imaging component). In this investigation we demonstrate that a single-beam approach can be utilized in a similar manner to multi-beam imaging, to collect sub-cellular biochemical images of brain neurons in a rapid time frame, without extensive modification of an existing beamline configuration. This study uses an applied example, imaging the same neuron in situ within a brain tissue section, with both synchrotron and thermal sources. The results highlight the advantage of improved spatial resolution/image quality and spectral quality (signal to noise ratio) that is obtained when a high magnification and high numerical aperture objective (52×, 0.65) is coupled to a synchrotron mid-infrared lightsource with a focal plane array detector. The approach we report may prove to be particularly appealing to numerous existing mid-infrared beamlines, allowing straightforward integration of sub-cellular biochemical imaging with existing non-imaging research applications.

abstract = "Abstract After spinal cord injury (SCI) in mammals, injured axons fail to regenerate. By contrast, lampreys recover from complete spinal transection and axons regenerate selectively in their correct paths. Yet the large, identified reticulospinal neurons in the lamprey brain vary greatly in their regenerative abilities – some have high regeneration capacity (probability of regeneration &gt; 50%) and others have low regeneration capacity (&lt; 30%) – even though they have similar projection paths. The presence of both regenerating and non-regenerating neurons located in the same brain region and projecting to the same axon tracts suggests that differences in their regenerating abilities depend upon factors intrinsic to the neurons. Previous work has suggested that axon regeneration, especially in PNS, could depend on epigenetic mechanisms of histone modifications, such as the acetylation of histone tails. Our data indicated that expression of the enzymes responsible for regulating the acetylation of histone (KATs and HDACs) - KAT2A, \{KAT5\} and \{P300\} and \{HDAC3\} did not change after \{SCI\} in either high regeneration capacity or low regeneration capacity neurons. In the present report, we show a novel and unexpected relationship between neuron regeneration abilities and expression of HDAC1. While \{HDAC1\} expression was downregulated in both high and low regeneration capacity neurons 2 and 4 weeks after SCI, it was upregulated at 7 weeks at almost all \{RS\} neurons. However, at 10 weeks post-transection only high regeneration capacity neurons displayed elevated \{HDAC1\} mRNA expression and \{HDAC1\} expression was again downregulated in low regeneration capacity neurons. Moreover, we show that \{HDAC1\} is preferentially expressed in regenerated neurons, but not in non-regenerating neurons. Together, these results suggest that \{SCI\} causes significant changes in \{HDAC1\} expression and that \{HDAC1\} expression in regenerating neurons may modulates a survival or regeneration programs.

Although the firing patterns of \{OT\} and \{VP\} neurons, both in vivo and in vitro, may appear different from each other, much is assumed about their characteristics. These assumptions make it practically impossible to obtain a confident phenotypic differentiation based exclusively on the firing patterns. The presence of a sustained outward rectifying potassium current (SOR) and/or an inward rectifying hyperpolarization-activated current (IR), which are presumably present in \{OT\} neurons and absent in \{VP\} neurons, has been used to distinguish between the two types of \{MNCs\} in the past. In this study, we aimed to analyze the accuracy of the phenotypic discrimination of \{MNCs\} based on the presence of rectifying currents using comparisons with the molecular phenotype of the cells, as determined by single-cell RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated that the phenotypes classified according to the electrophysiological protocol in brain slices do not match their molecular counterparts because vasopressinergic and intermediate neurons also exhibit both outward and inward rectifying currents. In addition, we also show that \{MNCs\} can change the relative proportion of each cell phenotype when the system is challenged by chronic hypertonicity (70% water restriction for 7 days). We conclude that for in vitro preparations, the combination of mRNA detection and immunohistochemistry seems to be preferable when trying to characterize a single \{MNC\} phenotype. "

In particular, the degree of motor specificity with which others' actions are simulated is highly debated. Human corticospinal excitability studies support the conjecture that a mirror mechanism encodes object-directed goals or low-level kinematic features of others' reaching and grasping actions. These interpretations lead to different experimental predictions and implications for the functional role of the simulation of others' actions. We propose that the representational granularity of the mirror mechanism cannot be any different from that of the motor system during action execution. Hence, drawing from motor control models, we propose that the building blocks of the mirror mechanism are the relatively few motor synergies explaining the variety of hand functions. The recognition of these synergies, from action observation, can be potentially very robust to visual noise and thus demonstrate a clear advantage of using motor knowledge for classifying others' action.

This established the loss of a shoulder during the recovery of the depolarization (K+)-induced transient, increased transient peak and area, and elevated shoulder level as evidence of diminished mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering. We then examined transients in Control neurons and neurons from the 4th lumbar (L4) and 5th lumbar (L5) dorsal root ganglia after \{L5\} spinal nerve ligation (SNL). The \{SNL\} \{L4\} neurons showed decreased transient peak and area compared to control neurons, while the \{SNL\} \{L5\} neurons showed increased shoulder level. Additionally, \{SNL\} \{L4\} neurons developed shoulders following transients with lower peaks than Control neurons. Application of \{FCCP\} plus oligomycin elevated resting [Ca2+]c in \{SNL\} \{L4\} neurons more than in Control neurons. Whereas application of \{FCCP\} plus oligomycin 2 s after neuronal depolarization initiated mitochondrial Ca2+ release in most Control and \{SNL\} \{L4\} neurons, this usually failed to release mitochondrial Ca2+ from \{SNL\} \{L5\} neurons. For comparable cytoplasmic Ca2+ loads, the releasable mitochondrial Ca2+ in \{SNL\} \{L5\} neurons was less than Control while it was increased in \{SNL\} \{L4\} neurons.

As a result, the same postsynaptic depolarizing current will trigger different firing patterns according to the neuronal cell type recorded. In brief, the firing pattern (output) of a neuron results from the integration of synaptic currents (input) and subliminal voltage-gated currents present in the somatic and dendritic membrane. In this chapter we shall study the mechanisms underlying the firing patterns of medium spiny neurons of the striatum, of inferior olivary neurons, of Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex, and of thalamic and subthalamic neurons.

In this coupled system we observe a phase-flip bifurcation, where the neurons synchronize out-of-phase at weak coupling and in-phase at strong coupling. We verify this by simulation of the circuit equations and construct a bifurcation diagram for varying coupling strength using the phase response curve and spike phase difference map.

The neurons connected together form circuits, and so the nervous system is composed of neuronal networks which transmit and process information. Neurons are excitable cells. Depending on the information they receive, neurons generate electrical signals and propagate them along their processes. This capacity is due to the presence of particular proteins in their plasma membrane which allow the selective passage of ions: the ion channels. Neurons are also secretory cells. Their secretory product is called a neurotransmitter. The release of a neurotransmitter occurs only in restricted regions, the synapses. The neurotransmitter is released in the extracellular space. The synaptic secretion is highly focalized and directed specifically on cell regions to which the neuron is connected. The synaptic secretion is then different (with only a few exceptions) from other secretory cells, such as from hormonal and exocrine cells which respectively release their secretory products into the general circulation (endocrine secretion) or the external environment (exocrine secretion).

However, recent studies extend their roles to include involvement in astrocytic signaling, memory consolidation, and gene expression. Emerging roles for these brain fuels and a readily-diffusible by-product are linked to differential fluxes in glycolytic and oxidative pathways, astrocytic glycogen dynamics, redox shifts, neuron-astrocyte interactions, and regulation of astrocytic activities by noradrenaline released from the locus coeruleus. Disproportionate utilization of carbohydrate compared with oxygen during brain activation is influenced by catecholamines, but its physiological basis is not understood and its magnitude may be affected by technical aspects of metabolite assays. Memory consolidation and gene expression are impaired by glycogenolysis blockade, and prevention of these deficits by injection of abnormally-high concentrations of lactate was interpreted as a requirement for astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttling in memory and gene expression. However, lactate transport was not measured and evidence for presumed shuttling is not compelling. In fact, high levels of lactate used to preserve memory consolidation and induce gene expression are sufficient to shut down neuronal firing via the \{HCAR1\} receptor. In contrast, low lactate levels activate a receptor in locus coeruleus that stimulates noradrenaline release that may activate astrocytes throughout brain. Physiological relevance of exogenous concentrations of lactate used to mimic and evaluate metabolic, molecular, and behavioral effects of lactate requires close correspondence with the normal lactate levels, the biochemical and cellular sources and sinks, and specificity of lactate delivery to target cells.

Clozapine and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclozapine (NDMC), have complex pharmacological properties, and interact with various neurotransmitter receptors. There are several biochemical studies reporting that \{NDMC\} exhibits a partial agonist profile at the human recombinant \{M1\} muscarinic receptors. However, direct electrophysiological evidence showing the ability of \{NDMC\} to activate native \{M1\} receptors in intact neurons is poor. Using rat hippocampal neurons, we previously demonstrated that activation of muscarinic receptors by a muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine M (oxo-M), induces a decrease in outward K+current at −40 mV. In the present study, using this muscarinic current response we assessed agonist and antagonist activities of clozapine and \{NDMC\} at native muscarinic receptors in intact hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Suppression of the oxo-M-induced current response by the \{M1\} antagonist pirenzepine was evident only in excitatory neurons, while the \{M3\} antagonist darifenacin was effective in both types of neurons. Muscarinic agonist activity of \{NDMC\} was higher than that of clozapine, higher in excitatory neurons than in inhibitory neurons, sensitive to pirenzepine, and partially masked when co-applied with clozapine. Muscarinic antagonist activity of clozapine as well as \{NDMC\} was not different between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but clozapine was more effective than NDMC. These results demonstrate that \{NDMC\} has the ability to activate native \{M1\} receptors expressed in hippocampal excitatory neurons, but its agonist activity might be limited in clozapine-treated patients because of the presence of excessive clozapine with muscarinic antagonist activity.

Ingestion of a high fat diet in rodents and obesity in human subjects is associated with chronic elevation of low plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a breakdown product of Gram-negative bacteria. The terminals of vagal afferent neurons are positioned within the gut mucosa to convey information from the gut to the brain to regulate food intake and are responsive to LPS. We hypothesized that chronic elevation of \{LPS\} could alter vagal afferent signaling. We surgically implanted osmotic mini-pumps that delivered a constant, low-dose of \{LPS\} into the intraperitoneal cavity of rats (12.5 μg/kg/hr for 6 weeks). LPS-treated rats developed hyperphagia and showed marked changes in vagal afferent neuron function. Chronic \{LPS\} treatment reduced vagal afferent leptin signaling, characterized by a decrease in leptin-induced \{STAT3\} phosphorylation. In addition, \{LPS\} treatment decreased cholecystokinin-induced satiety. There was no alteration in leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. These findings offer a mechanism by which a change in gut microflora can promote hyperphagia, possibly leading to obesity. "

Here, we applied whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to primary hippocampal neurons and show that intracellular Aβ42 delivery leads to increased spike discharge and action potential broadening through downregulation of A-type K+ currents. Pharmacologic studies showed that caspases and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) activation are required for these Aβ42-induced effects. Extracellular perfusion and subsequent internalization of Aβ42 increase spike discharge and promote GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of the Kv4.2 α-subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K+ currents, at Ser-616. In acute hippocampal slices derived from an adult triple-transgenic Alzheimer's mouse model, characterized by endogenous intracellular accumulation of Aβ42, \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons exhibit hyperexcitability accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Kv4.2 at Ser-616. Collectively, these data suggest that intraneuronal Aβ42 accumulation leads to an intracellular cascade culminating into caspases activation and GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Kv4.2 channels. These findings provide new insights into the toxic mechanisms triggered by intracellular Aβ42 and offer potentially new therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment. "

A key pathophysiological mechanism of abdominal pain is associated with disturbances of serotonergic transmission in feedback control loops of endogenous pain modulation in which the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) plays an important role. The receptors to serotonin (5-HT), and particularly the serotonin 3 (5-HT3) receptors have been extensively used as a potential target for abdominal pain treatment of \{IBS\} patients due to antinociceptive features of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The precise mechanisms underlying the antinociceptive action of these antagonists remain unclear. The main objective of our study was to evaluate the involvement of the 5-HT3 receptors in abdominal pain transmission within the VLM. Experiments were carried out on urethane-anaesthetized rats using the animal model of abdominal pain. Noxious colorectal distension (CRD) with a pressure of 80 mmHg induced a significant increase in \{VLM\} neuron-evoked activity and depressor reactions (171.1±12.7% and 64±1.8% to baseline, accordingly). Selective blockade of the 5-HT3 receptors with granisetron at doses of 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg (i.v) resulted in long-lasting (90 min) dose-dependent inhibition of \{VLM\} neuron-evoked activity and depressor reactions. When brainstem dorsal surface applications of granisetron (10 or 20 µM) were used, the changes were more pronounced. These results suggest involvement of the 5-HT3 receptors in abdominal pain transmission within the VLM, which will be discussed in relation to the central antinociceptive effect of granisetron. "

Furthermore, pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43, TARDBP, are found in sporadic and familial \{ALS\} cases. To study the molecular mechanisms of cellular toxicity due to TDP-43 mutations we generated a novel in vitro cellular model using a fluorescently tagged human genomic \{TARDBP\} locus carrying one of two ALS-associated mutations, \{A382T\} or M337V, which were used to generate site-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) human stable cell lines and \{BAC\} transgenic mice. In cell lines and primary motor neurons in culture, TDP-M337V mislocalized to the cytoplasm more frequently than wild-type \{TDP\} (wt-TDP) and TDP-A382T, an effect potentiated by oxidative stress. Expression of mutant TDP-M337V correlated with increased apoptosis detected by cleaved caspase-3 staining. Cells expressing mislocalized TDP-M337V spontaneously developed cytoplasmic aggregates, while for TDP-A382T aggregates were only revealed after endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by the calcium-modifying drug thapsigargin. Lowering Ca2 + concentration in the \{ER\} of wt-TDP cells partially recapitulated the effect of pathogenic mutations by increasing TDP-43 cytoplasmic mislocalization, suggesting Ca2 + dysregulation as a potential mediator of pathology through alterations in Bcl-2 protein levels. Ca2 + signaling from the \{ER\} was impaired in immortalized cells and primary neurons carrying TDP-43 mutations, with a 50% reduction in the levels of luminal \{ER\} Ca2 + stores content and delayed Ca2 + release compared with cells carrying wt-TDP. The deficits in Ca2 + release in human cells correlated with the upregulation of Bcl-2 and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bcl-2 restored the amplitude of Ca2 + oscillations in TDP-M337V cells. These results suggest that TDP-43 pathogenic mutations elicit cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43 and Bcl-2 mediated \{ER\} Ca2 + signaling dysregulation. "

Initial experimentation is done by tuning the I&amp;F model parameters by hand, to confirm the importance and relevance of determining the best parameter values. The \{GA\} is then used to automatically tune different parameter combinations of the pattern recognition model, which uses the I&amp;F neuron as core, to determine which parameters are worth including in the GA. The proposed method was tested with five different datasets, where no change was required to apply the model to each. Very good results were achieved in all test cases, but experiments where parameters of the neuron model were included converged faster. "

Guidance cues like the neuropilin receptors (Npn) and their ligands, the semaphorins (Sema) provide a tight spatiotemporal control of sensory and motor axon growth and guidance. Among this family of guidance partners the Sema3A-Npn1 interaction has been shown to be of great importance, since defective signaling leads to wiring deficits and defasciculation. For the embryonic stage these defects have been well described, however, also after birth the organism can adapt to new challenges by compensational mechanisms. Therefore, we used the mouse lines Olig2-Cre;Npn1cond and Npn1Sema− to investigate how postnatal organisms cope with the loss of Npn1 selectively from motor neurons or a systemic dysfunctional Sema3A-Npn1 signaling in the entire organism, respectively. While in Olig2-Cre+;Npn1cond−/− mice clear anatomical deficits in paw posturing, bone structure, as well as muscle and nerve composition became evident, Npn1Sema− mutants appeared anatomically normal. Furthermore, Olig2-Cre+;Npn1cond mutants revealed a dysfunctional extensor muscle innervation after single-train stimulation of the N.radial. Interestingly, these mice did not show obvious deficits in voluntary locomotion, however, skilled motor function was affected. In contrast, Npn1Sema− mutants were less affected in all behavioral tests and able to improve their performance over time. Our data suggest that loss of Sema3A-Npn1 signaling is not the only cause for the observed deficits in Olig2-Cre+;Npn1cond−/− mice and that additional, yet unknown binding partners for Npn1 may be involved that allow Npn1Sema− mutants to compensate for their developmental deficits.

We investigated the distribution and morphology of nitrergic neurons in the two main input structures of the basal ganglia of human brain: the striatum and subthalamic nucleus. Methods We studied samples of striatum (caudate and putamen) and subthalamic nucleus of 20 human brains from subjects without neurological/psychiatric diseases. The tissues were stained by histochemistry for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase activity and by immunohistochemistry for neuronal \{NO\} synthase (nNOS). Subsequently, we analyzed the nitrergic neuronal profile and its morphometric parameters. Results Our data corroborate that approximately 2% of neurons in striatum express nNOS and these exhibited morphology characteristic of interneurons. Posterior regions of the striatum have a higher nitrergic neuronal profile than anterior regions of this nucleus suggesting an anteroposterior gradient of nitrergic neurons. Posterior limbic-associated areas of the striatum have a higher nitrergic neuronal profile compared to other functional subdivisions. Also, approximately 90% of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus express nNOS. Conclusions A remarkable presence of nitrergic neurons in the human striatum and subthalamic nucleus suggests that \{NO\} may play a critical role in the physiology of these nuclei. "

abstract = "Abstract Triclosan (TCS) is a commonly used antimicrobial agent in personal care and sanitizing products, as well as in household items. Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of \{TCS\} in various human tissues. Several studies have reported the accumulation of \{TCS\} in fish and human brain tissue. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of \{TCS\} on apoptosis in mouse neocortical neurons after 7 days of culture in vitro following 3, 6 and 24 h of exposure. To explore the mechanism underlying the effects of \{TCS\} in neurons, we studied the activation and protein expression of the Fas receptor (FasR) and caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3, as well as \{DNA\} fragmentation in TCS-treated cells. Cultures of neocortical neurons were prepared from Swiss mouse embryos on day 15/16 of gestation. The cells were cultured in phenol red-free Neurobasal medium with \{B27\} and glutamine. The cultures were treated with concentrations of \{TCS\} ranging from 1 nM to 100 μM for 3, 6 and 24 h. The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in the culture medium to exclude the cytotoxic concentrations. The cytotoxic effects were only observed when the highest concentrations of \{TCS\} were used (50 and 100 μM). To study apoptosis, the activities of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were measured, and \{DNA\} fragmentation was evaluated. Our results are the first time to demonstrate that \{TCS\} can induce an apoptotic process in neocortical neurons in vitro. The data demonstrated that \{TCS\} caused caspase-3 activation, \{DNA\} fragmentation and apoptotic body formation. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of \{TCS\} activated the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, which is dependent on FasR and caspase-8 activation. However, it is also possible that \{TCS\} may activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway after long-term exposure. Therefore, further studies on the mechanism underlying the effects of \{TCS\} on the nervous system are needed. "

While non-human primate studies have suggested a role for the \{GPi\} in non-motor functions, there have been no single-unit studies of non-motor electrophysiological behavior of human \{GPi\} neurons. We therefore sought to extend these findings by collecting single-unit recordings from awake patients during functional stereotactic neurosurgery targeting the \{GPi\} for deep brain stimulation. To assess cellular responses to non-motor information, patients performed a reward task where virtual money could be won, lost, or neither, depending on their performance while cellular activity was monitored. Changes in the firing rates of isolated \{GPi\} neurons after the presentation of reward-related stimuli were compared between different reward contingencies (win, loss, null). We observed neurons that modulated their firing rate significantly to the presentation of reward-related stimuli. We furthermore found neurons that responded to visual-stimuli more broadly. This is the first single-unit evidence of human \{GPi\} neurons carrying non-motor information. These results are broadly consistent with previous findings in the animal literature and suggest non-motor information may be represented in the single-unit activity of human \{GPi\} neurons. "

However, current methods for quantifying apoptotic cells using conventional random cultures have shown great limitations, especially for the quantification of primary neurons. Randomly distributed neurons under primary culture conditions can lead to biased estimates, and vastly different estimates of cell numbers can be produced within the same experiment. In this study, we developed a simple, accurate, and reliable technique for quantifying apoptotic neurons by means of micropatterned cell cultures. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microstencil was used as a physical mask for micropatterning cell cultures, and primary granular neurons (GNs) were successfully cultured within the micropattern-confined regions and homogeneously distributed over the entire field of each pattern. As compared with the conventional method based on random cultures, the micropatterned culture method allowed for highly reproducible quantification of apoptotic cells. These results were also confirmed by using \{GNs\} derived from mice with neurodegeneration. We hope that this micropatterning method based on the use of a \{PDMS\} microstencil can overcome the technical obstacles existing in current biological studies and will serve as a powerful tool for facilitating the study of apoptosis-involved diseases.

It is found that the electromagnetic radiation can excite quiescent neuron but also can suppress the electrical activities in neuron as well.

The current study used a neonatal piglet model as piglets have a gyrencephalic brain with growth and development similar to human infants. Piglets were inoculated with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to evaluate how chronic neuroinflammation affects hippocampal neurogenesis and neuron morphology. Piglets in the neurogenesis study received one bromodeoxyuridine injection on postnatal day (PD) 7 and then were inoculated with PRRSV. Piglets were sacrificed at \{PD\} 28 and the number of BrdU+ cells and cell fate were quantified in the dentate gyrus. \{PRRSV\} piglets showed a 24% reduction in the number of newly divided cells forming neurons. Approximately 15% of newly divided cells formed microglia, but this was not affected by sex or PRRSV. Additionally, there was a sexual dimorphism of new cell survival in the dentate gyrus where males had more cells than females, and \{PRRSV\} infection caused a decreased survival in males only. Golgi impregnation was used to characterize dentate granule cell morphology. Sholl analysis revealed that \{PRRSV\} caused a change in inner granule cell morphology where the first branch point was extended further from the cell body. Males had more complex dendritic arbors than females in the outer granule cell layer, but this was not affected by PRRSV. There were no changes to dendritic spine density or morphology distribution.

To test the hypothesis that nAChR signaling in \{MHb\} cholinergic neurons could modulate anxiety, we expressed novel “gain of function” nAChR subunits selectively in \{MHb\} cholinergic neurons of adult mice. Mice expressing these mutant nAChRs exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior that was alleviated by blockade with a nAChR antagonist. To test the hypothesis that anxiety induced by nicotine withdrawal may be mediated by increased \{MHb\} nicotinic receptor signaling, we infused nAChR subtype selective antagonists into the \{MHb\} of nicotine naïve and withdrawn mice. While antagonists had little effect on nicotine naïve mice, blocking α4β2 or α6β2, but not α3β4 nAChRs in the \{MHb\} alleviated anxiety in mice undergoing nicotine withdrawal. Consistent with behavioral results, there was increased functional expression of nAChRs containing the α6 subunit in \{MHb\} neurons that also expressed the α4 subunit. Together, these data indicate that \{MHb\} cholinergic neurons regulate nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety via increased signaling through nicotinic receptors containing the α6 subunit and point toward nAChRs in \{MHb\} cholinergic neurons as molecular targets for smoking cessation therapeutics.

It is caused by a reduction or elimination of the expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Because fragile X syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder, it is important to fully document the cell type expression in the developing \{CNS\} to provide a better understanding of the molecular function of FMRP, and the pathogenesis of the syndrome. We investigated \{FMRP\} expression in the brain using double-labeling immunocytochemistry and cell type markers for neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (S100β), microglia (Iba-1), and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2). The hippocampus, striatum, cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, corpus callosum and cerebellum were assessed in wild-type C57/BL6 mice at postnatal days 0, 10, 20, and adult. Our results demonstrate that \{FMRP\} is ubiquitously expressed in neurons at all times and brain regions studied, except for corpus callosum where \{FMRP\} was predominantly present in astrocytes at all ages. \{FMRP\} expression in Iba-1 and NG2-positive cells was detected at postnatal day 0 and 10 and gradually decreased to very low or undetectable levels in postnatal day 20 and adult mice. Our results reveal that in addition to continuous and extensive expression in neurons in the immature and mature brain, \{FMRP\} is also present in astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia during the early and mid-postnatal developmental stages of brain maturation. Prominent expression of \{FMRP\} in glia during these crucial stages of brain development suggests an important contribution to normal brain function, and in its absence, to the fragile X phenotype.

Prostaglandin \{E2\} (PGE2) level increase was often reported during gastrointestinal disorder and prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors has been used for ameliorate the symptoms. Exogenous administration of \{PGE2\} induces gastrointestinal disorder, however, the mechanism of action is not known. Therefore, we tested \{PGE2\} effect on visceral afferent sensory neurons of the rat. Interestingly, \{PGE2\} itself did not evoked any response but enhanced serotonin (5-HT)-evoked currents up to 167% of the control level. The augmented 5-HT responses were completely inhibited by a 5-HT type 3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron. The PGE2-induced potentiation were blocked by a selective E-prostanoid type4 (EP4) receptors antagonist, L-161,982, but type1 and 2 receptor antagonist \{AH6809\} has no effect. A membrane permeable protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, \{KT5720\} also inhibited \{PGE2\} effects. \{PGE2\} induced 5-HT current augmentation was observed on 15% and 21% of the stomach and ileum projecting neurons, respectively. Current results suggest a synergistic signaling in visceral afferent neurons underlying gastrointestinal disorder involving \{PGE2\} potentiation of 5-HT currents. Our findings may open a possibility for screen a new type drugs with lower side effects than currently using steroidal prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors by selectively targeting \{EP4\} receptor/PKA pathway without interrupt prostaglandin synthesis.

Current evidence suggests that \{VENs\} represent a specialized neuronal type with a characteristic morphology that is present in several species across mammalian orders and most likely represent a population of pyramidal neurons present in ancestral mammals in the context of specific adaptive pressures. Within primates, \{VENs\} are observed only in the anthropoid lineage and are particularly vulnerable in human neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by deficits in social skills and emotional function. Moreover, recent evidence on the neurochemical phenotype, morphological features, and laminar and regional distribution of \{VENs\} suggests that this intriguing neuronal population could be critically involved in autonomic regulation.

The model neuron self-adjusts its synaptic parameters, so that the synapse to dendrite, according to a generalized delta-rule-like algorithm. The model is used to simulate directionally selective cells by the unsupervised learning algorithm. In the simulations, we initialize the interaction and dendrite of the neuron randomly and use the generalized delta-rule-like unsupervised learning algorithm to learn the two-dimensional multi-directional selectivity problem without an external teacher’s signals. Simulation results show that the directionally selective cells can be formed by unsupervised learning, acquiring the required number of dendritic branches, and if needed, enhanced and if not, eliminated. Further, the results show whether a synapse exists; if it exists, where and what type (excitatory or inhibitory) of synapse it is. This leads us to believe that the proposed neuron model may be considerably more powerful on computations than the McCulloch–Pitts model because theoretically a single neuron or a single layer of such neurons is capable of solving any complex problem. These may also lead to a completely new technique for analyzing the mechanisms and principles of neurons, dendrites, and synapses. "

Because hiPSCs represent an almost limitless source of patient-derived neurons that retain the genetic variations thought to contribute to disease etiology, they have been heralded as a patient-specific platform for high throughput drug screening. However, the utility of current protocols for generating neurons from hiPSCs remains limited by protracted differentiation timelines and heterogeneity of the neuronal phenotypes produced. Neuronal induction via the forced expression of exogenous transcription factors rapidly induces defined populations of functional neurons from fibroblasts and hiPSCs. Here, we describe an adapted protocol that accelerates maturation of functional excitatory neurons from hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) via lentiviral transduction of Neurogenin 2 (using both mNgn2 and hNGN2). This methodology, relying upon a robust and scalable starting population of hiPSC NPCs, should be readily amenable to scaling for hiPSC-based high-throughput drug screening. "

Despite its name, \{PCOS\} may result from impaired neuronal circuits in the brain that regulate steroid hormone feedback to the hypothalamo–pituitary–gonadal axis. Ovarian function in all mammals is controlled by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, a small group of neurons that reside in the pre-optic area of the hypothalamus. GnRH neurons drive the secretion of the gonadotropins from the pituitary gland that subsequently control ovarian function, including the production of gonadal steroid hormones. These hormones, in turn, provide important feedback signals to GnRH neurons via a hormone sensitive neuronal network in the brain. In many women with \{PCOS\} this feedback pathway is impaired, resulting in the downstream consequences of the syndrome. This review will explore what is currently known from clinical and animal studies about the identity, relative contribution and significance of the individual neuronal components within the GnRH neuronal network that contribute to the pathophysiology of PCOS. We review evidence for the specific neuronal pathways hypothesised to mediate progesterone negative feedback to GnRH neurons, and discuss the potential mechanisms by which androgens may evoke disruptions in these circuits at different developmental time points. Finally, this review discusses data providing compelling support for disordered progesterone-sensitive \{GABAergic\} input to GnRH neurons, originating specifically within the arcuate nucleus in prenatal androgen induced forms of PCOS.

Many BDNF-ir neurons were medium in size and located throughout the jugular and nodose ganglia. When Fluorogold was injected into the wall of the cervical esophagus, many retrogradely Fluorogold-labeled neurons were found in both the jugular ganglion and the nodose ganglion. When Fluorogold was injected into the body of the stomach or applied to the cut end of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve, numerous Fluorogold-labeled neurons were found mostly in the nodose ganglion. Double-labeling combining immunohistochemistry for \{BDNF\} and retrograde tracing with Fluorogold showed that more than 90% of the neurons in the jugular ganglion and the nodose ganglion projecting to the cervical esophagus contained BDNF-like immunoreactivity. In the cases of both Fluorogold injection into the stomach and Fluorogold application to the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve, almost all Fluorogold-labeled neurons in the nodose ganglion contained BDNF-like immunoreactivity. These results indicated that almost all vagal sensory neurons located in either the jugular ganglion or the nodose ganglion that innervate the gastrointestinal tract are BDNF-ir neurons. "

However, the role of Dicer in adult mature excitatory neuron survival is not clear. In this study, we generated a mouse model in which Dicer is conditionally inactivated in forebrain excitatory neurons from a mature stage, and this line is termed Dicer conditional knockout (cKO). Significant age-dependent neurodegeneration was observed in the cortex of Dicer cKO mice, indicating an important role of Dicer in the maintenance of mature excitatory neuron survival in the adult cortex. Impairment in adult neurogenesis was found in 6-month but not in young Dicer cKO mice. However, astrocytosis was detected in young Dicer cKO mice displaying no apparent neuron loss. Overall, neurogenesis impairment and neuroinflammation may play pivotal roles in the progression of neurodegeneration. "

Neural circuits underlying \{DOR\} activities have been poorly explored by genetic approaches. We used conditional mouse mutagenesis to elucidate receptor function in \{GABAergic\} neurons of the forebrain. Methods We characterized \{DOR\} distribution in the brain of Dlx5/6-CreXOprd1fl/fl (Dlx-DOR) mice and tested main central \{DOR\} functions through behavioral testing. Results The \{DOR\} proteins were strongly deleted in olfactory bulb and striatum and remained intact in cortex and basolateral amygdala. Olfactory perception, circadian activity, and despair-like behaviors were unchanged. In contrast, locomotor stimulant effects of \{SNC80\} (DOR agonist) and \{SKF81297\} (D1 agonist) were abolished and increased, respectively. The Dlx-DOR mice showed lower levels of anxiety in the elevated plus maze, opposing the known high anxiety in constitutive \{DOR\} knockout animals. Also, Dlx-DOR mice reached the food more rapidly in a novelty suppressed feeding task, despite their lower motivation for food reward observed in an operant paradigm. Finally, c-fos protein staining after novelty suppressed feeding was strongly reduced in amygdala, concordant with the low anxiety phenotype of Dlx-DOR mice. Conclusions We demonstrate that \{DORs\} expressed in the forebrain mediate the described locomotor effect of \{SNC80\} and inhibit D1-stimulated hyperactivity. Our data also reveal an unanticipated anxiogenic role for this particular \{DOR\} subpopulation, with a potential novel adaptive role. In emotional responses, \{DORs\} exert dual anxiolytic and anxiogenic roles, both of which may have implications in the area of anxiety disorders. "

Extensive evidence suggests that inhibition of tropomyosin related kinase type B (TrkB) signaling limits epileptogenesis. It has been reported that miR-204 directly targeted and downregulated TrkB protein in a variety of cancers to suppress tumorigenesis, but its effect on epileptogenesis is unknown. Here we showed that miR-204 was downregulated in cultured hippocampal neurons following status epilepticus (SE) induced by Mg2+-free treatment. Overexpression of miR-204 using a transfection technique negatively regulated the expression of TrkB mRNA. Insight into the downstream signaling pathway activated by TrkB may provide valuable clues to the underlying mechanisms of epileptogenesis. Biochemical measures revealed activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) signaling molecules in the Mg2+-free model in hippocampal neurons, of which ERK1/2-CREB but not PLCγ1 signaling pathway was able to be inhibited by miR-204. Epileptiform discharges assessed using whole-cell current–clamp techniques were suppressed by miR-204 in cultured hippocampus neurons of SE. These results suggest that miR-204 exerts an antiepileptogenic effect in the Mg2+-free model in hippocampal neurons through regulating TrkB and downstream ERK1/2-CREB signaling pathway. "

In contrast to the conventional viewpoint, in which the external stimulus dominantly drives the response behavior, recent studies have revealed that not only external stimuli, but also intrinsic neural dynamics, contribute to the generation of response behavior. In particular, spontaneous activity, which is neural activity without extensive external stimuli, has been found to exhibit similar patterns to those evoked by external inputs, from time to time. In order to further understand the role of this spontaneous activity on the response, we propose a viewpoint, memories-as-bifurcations, that differs from the traditional memories-as-attractors viewpoint. According to this viewpoint, memory is recalled when spontaneous neural activity is changed to an appropriate output activity upon the application of an input. After reviewing the previous rate-coding model embodying this viewpoint, we employ a model of a spiking neuron network that can embed input/output associations, and study the dynamics of collective neural activity. The organized neural activity, which matched the target pattern, is shown to be generated even under application of stochastic input, while the spontaneous activity, which apparently shows noisy dynamics, is found to exhibit selectively higher similarity with evoked activities corresponding to embedded target patterns. These results suggest that such an intrinsic structure in the spontaneous activity might play a role in generating the higher response. The relevance of these results to biological neural processing is also discussed. "

Here, we investigated various aspects of the functional relationship between \{L1\} and phosphorylated \{PKD1\} (pPKD1) in cerebellar granule neurons. To study the relationship between \{L1\} and \{PKD1\} phosphorylation, human cerebellar tissue microarrays were subject to immunofluorescence staining. We observed a positive correlation between \{L1\} protein levels and \{PKD1\} phosphorylation. In addition, \{L1\} also co-localized with pPKD1. To analyze the regulatory role of \{L1\} on \{PKD1\} phosphorylation, primary mouse cerebellar granule neurons were treated with various concentrations of rL1 for 48 h. Using Western blot, we revealed that \{L1\} significantly increased \{PKD1\} phosphorylation compared with vehicle control, with the maximal effect observed at 5 nM. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly increased by 2.5 nM and 10 nM L1, with no apparent change in \{SRC\} phosphorylation. However, \{SRC\} expression was markedly reduced by 10 nM rL1. \{AKT1\} expression and phosphorylation levels were significantly increased by rL1, with the maximal effect observed at 2.5 and 5 nM, respectively. Our combined data revealed a positive relationship between \{L1\} and pPKD1 in both cultured cerebellar neurons and human cerebellar tissue, suggesting that \{L1\} functions in the modulation of \{PKD1\} phosphorylation.

abstract = "Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with prominent neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra (SN) and other parts of the brain. Previous studies in models of traumatic and neurodegenerative \{CNS\} disease showed that pharmacological inhibition of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), a molecule involved in inhibitory signaling in the CNS, by small-molecule inhibitors improves neuronal survival and increases regeneration. Most small-molecule inhibitors, however, offer only limited target specificity and also inhibit other kinases, including both \{ROCK\} isoforms. To establish the role of the predominantly brain-expressed \{ROCK2\} isoform in models of regeneration and PD, we used adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) to specifically knockdown \{ROCK2\} in neurons. Rat primary midbrain neurons (PMN) were transduced with \{AAV\} expressing short-hairpin-RNA (shRNA) against \{ROCK2\} and LIM-domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), one of the downstream targets of ROCK2. While knock-down of \{ROCK2\} and \{LIMK1\} both enhanced neurite regeneration in a traumatic scratch lesion model, only ROCK2-shRNA protected \{PMN\} against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) toxicity. Moreover, AAV.ROCK2-shRNA increased levels of the pro-survival markers Bcl-2 and phospho-Erk1. In vivo, AAV.ROCK2-shRNA vectors were injected into the ipsilateral \{SN\} and a unilateral 6-OHDA striatal lesion was performed. After four weeks, behavioral, immunohistochemical and biochemical alterations were investigated. Downregulation of \{ROCK2\} protected dopaminergic neurons in the \{SN\} from 6-OHDA-induced degeneration and resulted in significantly increased TH-positive neuron numbers. This effect, however, was confined to nigral neuronal somata as striatal terminal density, dopamine and metabolite levels were not significantly preserved. Interestingly, motor behavior was improved in the ROCK2-shRNA treated animals compared to control after four weeks. Our studies thus confirm \{ROCK2\} as a promising therapeutic target in models of \{PD\} and demonstrate that neuron-specific inhibition of \{ROCK2\} promotes survival of lesioned dopaminergic neurons.

We found that activation of mGluR \{II\} by synthetic agonists resulted in a selective increase of the high-threshold \{KV\} currents. More importantly, synaptically released glutamate (with reuptake blocked) also enhanced the high-threshold \{KV\} currents. The enhancement was frequency-coding region dependent, being more pronounced in low-frequency neurons compared to middle- and high-frequency neurons. The intracellular mechanism involved the Gβγ signaling pathway associated with phospholipase C and protein kinase C. The modulation strengthened membrane outward rectification, sharpened action potentials, and improved the ability of \{NL\} neurons to follow high-frequency inputs. These data suggest that mGluR \{II\} provides a feedforward modulatory mechanism that may regulate temporal processing under the condition of heightened synaptic inputs. "

The precise origin of the different N-terminally modified Aβ peptides currently remains unknown. To assess the contribution of specific cell types to the formation of different N-terminally truncated Aβ peptides, supernatants from serum-free primary cell cultures of chicken neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, as well as human astrocytes, were analyzed by Aβ-ELISA and one- and two-dimensional SDS-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis.

Neurons predominantly secreted Aβ peptides that begin at Asp1, whereas those released from astrocytes and microglia included high proportions of N-terminally modified Aβ peptides, presumably including Aβ 2/3-x and 4/5-x.

We derive charge-balanced minimum-power controls for a general phase model using the maximum principle, where the cases with unbounded and bounded control amplitude are examined. The latter is of fundamental importance because phase models are valid under weak forcing. The developed optimal control strategies are applied to both mathematically ideal and experimentally observed phase models to demonstrate their applicability, including the widely studied Hodgkin–Huxley model.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by extensive synaptic and circuit dysfunction. It is still unclear about the alterations in intrinsic excitability of individual neurons and their link to hyperexcitable circuitry. In this study, whole cell patch-clamp recordings were employed to characterize the membrane and firing properties of layer \{IV\} cells in slices of the somatosensory cortex of Fmr-1 knockout (KO) mice. These cells generally exhibited a regular spiking (RS) pattern, while there were significant increases in the number of cells that adopted intrinsic bursting (IB) compared with age-matched wild type (WT) cells. The cells subgrouped according to their firing patterns and maturation differed significantly in membrane and discharge properties between \{KO\} and WT. The changes in the intrinsic properties were consistent with highly facilitated discharges in \{KO\} cells induced by current injection. Spontaneous activities of \{RS\} neurons driven by local network were also increased in the \{KO\} cells, especially in neonate groups. Under an epileptiform condition mimicked by omission of Mg2 + in extracellular solution, these \{RS\} neurons from \{KO\} mice were more likely to switch to burst discharges. Analysis on bursts revealed that the \{KO\} cells tended to form burst discharges and even severe events manifested as seizure-like ictal discharges. These results suggest that alterations in intrinsic properties in individual neurons are involved in the abnormal excitability of cortical circuitry and possibly account for the pathogenesis of epilepsy in FXS.

abstract = "Abstract The development of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons is a complex process that requires the precise spatial and temporal expression of numerous genes. Here, we report that Ebf3, a transcription factor, plays a critical role in the terminal development of \{DA\} neurons. We found a specific upregulation of Ebf3 in Dicer knockout midbrain \{DA\} neurons and dynamic patterns of Ebf3 expression during the development of \{DA\} neurons. We further demonstrated that the overexpression of Ebf3 at the neural precursor stage of embryonic stem (ES) differentiation induces a significant increase in the number of TH+ \{DA\} neurons, whereas the suppression of Ebf3 leads to significant reduction in the development of TH+ \{DA\} neurons. Additionally, we found that Ebf3 is a candidate target for miR218 during \{DA\} neuronal development, such that the regulation of Ebf3 expression by miR218 controls the terminal differentiation of \{DA\} neurons. Thus, our data suggest that complex transcription factor–miRNA regulation is critical for the development of midbrain \{DA\} neurons. "

abstract = "Abstract There has been increasing interest in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), given its potential regulatory role in many aversion-related behaviors. The \{RMTg\} contains mostly \{GABAergic\} neurons, sends a dense inhibitory projection to dopamine neurons in the midbrain, and is rich with μ-opioid receptors (MOR). Like most addictive drugs, ethanol has both aversive and rewarding properties. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of ethanol, particularly the aversive effect that limits its intake are not well understood. Recent studies have linked aversion with synaptic inhibition of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. To determine a potential role that the \{RMTg\} plays in the effect of ethanol, in this study, we employed a neurotoxin, dermorphin-saporin (DS), to lesion \{RMTg\} neurons prior to assessing ethanol-related behaviors. Rats were infused with \{DS\} bilaterally into the RMTg. This manipulation substantially increased the intake and preference for ethanol but not sucrose. It also reduced the number of neurons with \{MOR\} and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 immunoreactivity within the RMTg. These changes did not occur after intra-RMTg infusion of blank saporin or vehicle. Importantly, intra-RMTg \{DS\} infusion significantly enhanced expression of conditioned place preference induced by ethanol (2 g/kg, i.p.), and slowed the extinction process. These results suggest that MOR-expressing \{GABAergic\} neurons in the \{RMTg\} contribute significantly to the regulation of ethanol consumption and related behaviors. "

Therapeutic effects have been reported for low intensity rTMS (LI-rTMS) although these remain poorly understood. Objective Our study describes for the first time a systematic comparison of the cellular and molecular changes in neurons in vitro induced by low intensity magnetic stimulation at different frequencies. Methods We applied 5 different low intensity repetitive magnetic stimulation (LI-rMS) protocols to neuron-enriched primary cortical cultures for 4 days and assessed survival, and morphological and biochemical change. Results We show pattern-specific effects of LI-rMS: simple frequency pulse trains (10 Hz and 100 Hz) impaired cell survival, while more complex stimulation patterns (theta-burst and a biomimetic frequency) did not. Moreover, only 1 Hz stimulation modified neuronal morphology, inhibiting neurite outgrowth. To understand mechanisms underlying these differential effects, we measured intracellular calcium concentration during LI-rMS and subsequent changes in gene expression. All LI-rMS frequencies increased intracellular calcium, but rather than influx from the extracellular milieu typical of depolarization, all frequencies induced calcium release from neuronal intracellular stores. Furthermore, we observed pattern-specific changes in expression of genes related to apoptosis and neurite outgrowth, consistent with our morphological data on cell survival and neurite branching. Conclusions Thus, in addition to the known effects on cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity, our data demonstrate that LI-rMS can change the survival and structural complexity of neurons. These findings provide a cellular and molecular framework for understanding what low intensity magnetic stimulation may contribute to human rTMS outcomes. "

It is now considered a multi-factorial and multi-systemic disorder in which alterations of the crosstalk between neuronal and non-neuronal cell types might influence the course of the disease. In this review, we will provide evidence that dysfunctions of affected muscle cells are not only a marginal consequence of denervation associated to motor neurons loss, but a direct consequence of cell muscle toxicity of mutant SOD1. In muscle, the misfolded state of mutant \{SOD1\} protein, unlike in motor neurons, does not appear to have direct effects on protein aggregation and mitochondrial functionality. Muscle cells are, in fact, more capable than motor neurons to handle misfolded proteins, suggesting that mutant \{SOD1\} toxicity in muscle is not mediated by classical mechanisms of intracellular misfolded proteins accumulation. Several recent works indicate that a higher activation of molecular chaperones and degradative systems is present in muscle cells, which for this reason are possibly able to better manage misfolded mutant SOD1. However, several alterations in gene expression and regenerative potential of skeletal muscles have also been reported as a consequence of the expression of mutant \{SOD1\} in muscle. Whether these changes in muscle cells are causative of \{ALS\} or a consequence of motor neuron alterations is not yet clear, but their elucidation is very important, since the understanding of the mechanisms involved in mutant \{SOD1\} toxicity in muscle may facilitate the design of treatments directed toward this specific tissue to treat \{ALS\} or at least to delay disease progression.

Recently our group demonstrated that there is extra-nuclear labeling for ERα, ERβ, and \{GPER1\} in the striatum, but that ERα and \{GPER1\} are not localized to dopaminergic neurons in this region. \{GABAergic\} neurons are the most common type of neuron in the striatum, and changes in \{GABA\} transmission affect dopamine transmission. Thus, to determine whether ERα or \{GPER1\} are localized to \{GABAergic\} neurons, we double labeled the striatum with antibodies for ERα or \{GPER1\} and \{GABA\} and examined them using electron microscopy. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that ERα and \{GPER1\} are localized exclusively to extranuclear sites in the striatum, and ∼35% of the dendrites and axon terminals labeled for these receptors contain \{GABA\} immunoreactivity. Binding at membrane-associated ERα and \{GPER1\} could account for rapid estrogen-induced decreases in \{GABA\} transmission in the striatum, which, in turn, could affect dopamine transmission in this region.

In this study, primary rat cerebral cortical neurons were exposed to Cd, which significantly decreased cell viability and the B-cell lymphoma 2/Bcl-2 associate X protein (Bcl-2/Bax) ratio and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, release of cytochrome c, cleavages of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF).

Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) constitute 96% of the afferent nerve population and, in contrast to other mammals, their soma and pre- and post-somatic segments are unmyelinated. Type \{II\} nerve soma and fibers are unmyelinated. Histopathology and clinical experience imply that human \{SGNs\} can persist electrically excitable without dendrites, thus lacking connection to the organ of Corti. The biological background to this phenomenon remains elusive. We analyzed the pre- and post-somatic segments of the type I human \{SGNs\} using immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in normal and pathological conditions. These segments were found surrounded by non-myelinated Schwann cells (NMSCs) showing strong intracellular expression of laminin-β2/collagen IV. These cells also bordered the perikaryal entry zone and disclosed surface rugosities outlined by a folded basement membrane (BM) expressing laminin-β2 and collagen IV. It is presumed that human large \{SGNs\} are demarcated by three cell categories: (a) myelinated Schwann cells, (b) \{NMSCs\} and (c) satellite glial cells (SGCs). Their \{BMs\} express laminin-β2/collagen \{IV\} and reaches the \{BM\} of the sensory epithelium at the habenula perforata. We speculate that the \{NMSCs\} protect \{SGNs\} from further degeneration following dendrite loss. It may give further explanation why \{SGNs\} can persist as electrically excitable monopolar cells even after long-time deafness, a blessing for the deaf treated with cochlear implantation. "

Cortical circuits are formed by, first, a larger population of excitatory so-called principal cells (i.e., glutamatergic pyramidal cells; ca. 80–88%), which issue long-distance projections, in addition to local recurrent collaterals, which form the major part of local cortical excitatory circuits (Douglas, R. J., &amp; Martin, K. A. C. (2007). Mapping the matrix: The ways of neocortex. Neuron 56, 226–238; Feldmeyer, D., Brecht, M., Helmchen, F., Petersen, C. C. H., Poulet, J. F. A., Staiger, J. F. (2013).

Mapping functional connectivity in barrel-related columns reveals layer- and cell type-specific microcircuits. Brain Structure and Function 212, 107–119). A second, smaller population of inhibitory also called local or short-axoned interneurons (i.e., \{GABAergic\} neurons; ca. 12–20%), however, contribute heavily to intracortical microcircuits, too. They can be subdivided by their location not only in specific areas, layers, or columns, which possess specific input–output relationships, but also in terms of morphology, electrophysiology, molecular expression profiles, and subcellular target specificity (Ascoli, G.

Here, it is proposed that, at present, in the rodent neocortex, this population of \{GABAergic\} neurons can be reasonably divided into six different types: (i) axo-axonic cells, (ii) basket cells, (iii) Martinotti cells, (iv) bipolar/bitufted cells, (v) neurogliaform cells, and (vi) projection neurons. A major topic for future research will be to determine how much within-type diversity does exist, that is, how many subtypes can reasonably be distinguished and what are their genuine functions in the cortical circuitry.

Previous studies demonstrate distinct neuroplasticity adaptations in the two medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine receptor \{D1\} versus dopamine receptor D2, in reward and reinforcement leading to opposing roles for these \{MSNs\} in these behaviors. However, the distinct roles of nucleus accumbens \{MSN\} subtypes, in depression, remain poorly understood. Methods Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we examined excitatory input to \{MSN\} subtypes and intrinsic excitability measures in D1-green fluorescent protein and D2-green fluorescent protein bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice that underwent chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Optogenetic and pharmacogenetic approaches were used to bidirectionally alter firing of D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs after \{CSDS\} or before a subthreshold social defeat stress in D1-Cre or D2-Cre bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice. Results We demonstrate that the frequency of excitatory synaptic input is decreased in D1-MSNs and increased in D2-MSNs in mice displaying depression-like behaviors after CSDS. Enhancing activity in D1-MSNs results in resilient behavioral outcomes, while inhibition of these \{MSNs\} induces depression-like outcomes after CSDS. Bidirectional modulation of D2-MSNs does not alter behavioral responses to CSDS; however, repeated activation of D2-MSNs in stress naïve mice induces social avoidance following subthreshold social defeat stress. Conclusions Our studies uncover novel functions of \{MSN\} subtypes in depression-like outcomes. Notably, bidirectional alteration of D1-MSN activity promotes opposite behavioral outcomes to chronic social stress. Therefore, targeting D1-MSN activity may provide novel treatment strategies for depression or other affective disorders. "

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays an important role in the defense of oxidative stress by regulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (γGCL) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). We investigated whether treadmill exercise protects dopaminergic neurons by regulating the Nrf2 antioxidant system in a 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+)-induced parkinsonian rat model. We found that MPP+ induced early decreases in total glutathione level and Nrf2/γGCLC (catalytic subunit of γGCL) expression, but late upregulation of HO-1 expression in association with loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter expression in the striatum. Treadmill exercise for 4 weeks induced upregulation of Nrf2 and γGCLC expression, and also prevented the MPP+-induced downregulation of Nrf2/γGCLC/glutathione, HO-1 upregulation, and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Moreover, the protective effect of exercise was blocked by the knockdown of Nrf2 using a lentivirus-carried shNrf2 delivery system. These results demonstrate an essential role of Nrf2 in the exercise-mediated protective effect that exercise enhances the nigrostriatal Nrf2 antioxidant defense capacity to protect dopaminergic neurons against the MPP+-induced toxicity.

We employ the optimal control theory to design a low energy \{EF\} input for a reduced two-compartment model. It works by driving the neuron to closely track a prescriptive spike train. A cost function is introduced to balance the contradictory objectives, i.e., tracking errors and \{EF\} stimulus energy. By using the calculus of variations, we transform the minimization of cost function to a six-dimensional two-point boundary value problem (BVP). Through solving the obtained \{BVP\} in the cases of three fundamental bifurcations, it is shown that the control method is able to provide an optimal \{EF\} stimulus of reduced energy for the neuron to effectively track a prescriptive spike train. Further, the feasibility of the adopted method is interpreted from the point of view of the biophysical basis of spike initiation. These investigations are conducive to designing stimulating dose for extracellular neural stimulation, which are also helpful to interpret the effects of extracellular field on neural activity. "

This has provided fresh insights for theoretical models of empathy, and substantially influenced the academic and public conceptions about this complex social skill. The present paper highlights three key issues which are often linked to empathy, but which at the same time might obscure our understanding of it. These issues are: (1) shared neural activations and whether these can be interpreted as evidence for simulation accounts of empathy; (2) the causal link of empathy to our presumed mirror neuron system; and (3) the question whether increasing empathy will result in better moral decisions and behaviors. The aim of our review is to provide the basis for critically evaluating our current understanding of empathy, and its public reception, and to inspire new research directions. "

Several lines of evidence indicate that the pontine \{KF\} region plays an important role in the control of the upper airways for the maintenance of appropriate airflow to and from the lungs. Specifically, we hypothesized that the \{KF\} region is involved in mediating the response of the hypoglossal motor activity to central respiratory chemoreflex activation and to stimulation of the chemoreceptor neurons within the \{RTN\} region. To test this hypothesis, we combined immunohistochemistry and physiological experiments. We found that in the KF, the majority of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)-labeled axonal varicosities contained detectable levels of vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGLUT2), but few contained glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67). The majority of the \{RTN\} neurons that were FluorGold (FG)-immunoreactive (i.e., projected to the KF) contained hypercapnia-induced Fos, but did not express tyrosine hydroxylase. In urethane-anesthetized sino-aortic denervated and vagotomized male Wistar rats, hypercapnia (10% CO2) or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) injection (0.1 mM) in the \{RTN\} increased diaphragm (DiaEMG) and genioglossus muscle (GGEMG) activities and elicited abdominal (AbdEMG) activity. Bilateral injection of muscimol (GABA-A agonist; 2 mM) into the \{KF\} region reduced the increase in DiaEMG and \{GGEMG\} produced by hypercapnia or \{NMDA\} into the RTN. Our data suggest that activation of chemoreceptor neurons in the \{RTN\} produces a significant increase in the genioglossus muscle activity and the excitatory pathway is dependent on the neurons located in the dorsolateral pontine \{KF\} region.

Small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels on neurons supply strong negative feedback control on neuronal excitability by affecting afterhyperpolarization (AHP). However, the role of \{SK\} channels in regulating tonic-firing \{SG\} neuron excitability remains elusive. In the present study, whole-cell recordings were conducted in \{SG\} neurons from acute spinal cord slices of adult rats. The \{SK\} channel opener 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO) attenuated spike discharges and increased \{AHP\} amplitudes; this effect was mimicked by a high Ca2+ external solution. Systemic administration of 1-EBIO attenuated the thermal-induced nociception behavior. Conversely, the inhibition of \{SK\} channels with apamin, a specific \{SK\} channel inhibitor, increased neuronal excitability and decreased the \{AHP\} amplitudes; this effect was mimicked by a Ca2+-free external solution. Apamin increased excitatory synaptic transmission by increasing the amplitudes of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (eEPSPs). This facilitation depended on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, extracellular Mg2+ and intracellular Ca2+. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were also involved in the apamin-induced effects. Strikingly, 1-EBIO action on decreasing excitability persisted in the presence of apamin, indicating that 1-EBIO manipulates \{SK\} channels via a pathway rather than via apamin-sensitive \{SK\} channels. The data reveal a previously uncharacterized mechanism for manipulating \{SG\} neuronal excitability by Ca2+ conductances via both apamin-sensitive and apamin-insensitive pathways. Because \{SG\} neurons in the dorsal horn are involved in regulating nociception, manipulating neuronal excitability via \{SK\} channels indicates a potential therapeutic target. "

Previous studies have shown that alpha1-adrenoreceptors (α1-AR) are primarily found pre-synaptically at this area. We hypothesized that \{GABA\} released onto VTA-dopamine (DA) cells is modulated by pre-synaptic α1-AR. Recordings were obtained from putative VTA-DA cells of male Sprague–Dawley rats (28–50 days postnatal) using whole-cell voltage clamp technique. Phenylephrine (10 μM; α1-AR agonist) decreased the amplitude of \{GABAA\} receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked by electrical stimulation of afferent fibers (n = 7; p &lt; 0.05). Prazosin (1 μM, α1-AR antagonist), blocked this effect. Paired-pulse ratios were increased by phenylephrine application (n = 13; p &lt; 0.05) indicating a presynaptic site of action. Spontaneous \{IPSCs\} frequency but not amplitude, were decreased in the presence of phenylephrine (n = 7; p &lt; 0.05). However, frequency or amplitude of miniature \{IPSCs\} were not changed (n = 9; p &gt; 0.05). Phenylephrine in low Ca2+ (1 mM) medium decreased \{IPSC\} amplitude (n = 7; p &lt; 0.05). Chelerythrine (a protein kinase C inhibitor) blocked the α1-AR action on \{IPSC\} amplitude (n = 6; p &lt; 0.05). Phenylephrine failed to decrease \{IPSCs\} amplitude in the presence of paxilline, a \{BK\} channel blocker (n = 7; p &lt; 0.05). Taken together, these results demonstrate that α1-ARs at presynaptic terminals can modulate \{GABA\} release onto VTA-DA cells. Drug-induced changes in α1-AR could contribute to the modifications occurring in the \{VTA\} during the addiction process.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings evidenced inwardly directed non-desensitizing currents following adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP; 600 µM) or 2′-3′-o-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP; 100 µM) administration to cells bathed in a medium with no-added divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+). Nucleotide-activated currents were inhibited by superfusion of 2.5 mM Ca2+, 1.2 mM Mg2+ or 100 nM Brilliant Blue G (BBG), hence indicating the expression of ionotropic \{P2X7\} receptors. Fura-2 calcium imaging showed [Ca2+]i elevations in response to \{ATP\} or BzATP at the somas and at a small number of axodendritic regions of granule neurons. Differential sensitivity of these [Ca2+]i increases to three different \{P2X7\} receptor antagonists (100 nM BBG, 10 μM 4-[(2S)-2-[(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)methylamino]-3-oxo-3-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl] phenyl isoquinolinesulfonic acid ester, KN-62, and 1 μM 3-(5-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1H-tetrazol-1-yl)methyl pyridine hydrochloride hydrate, A-438079) revealed that \{P2X7\} receptors are co-expressed with different \{P2Y\} receptors along the plasmalemma of granule neurons. Finally, experiments with the fluorescent dye YO-PRO-1 indicated that prolonged stimulation of \{P2X7\} receptors does not lead to the opening of a membrane pore permeable to large cations. Altogether, our results emphasise the expression of functional \{P2X7\} receptors at both the axodendritic and somatic levels in mouse cerebellar granule neurons, and favour the notion that \{P2X7\} receptors might function in a subcellular localisation-specific manner: presynaptically, by controlling glutamate release, and on the cell somas, by supporting granule neuron survival against glutamate excytotoxicity.

Furthermore, the decrease in the \{LTP\} at \{CA1\} synapses requires activation of \{IP3Rs\} during \{LFS\} and activation of calcineurin after LFS. These results suggest that, at hippocampal \{CA1\} neuron synapses, HFS-induced \{IP3R\} activation, which is modulated by the subsequent LFS, results in postsynaptic protein dephosphorylation after the LFS, leading to a decrease in the field \{EPSP\} and in the HFS-induced LTP.

The results showed that \{ITTO\} elicited an increase in expiratory time (Te) but did not affect inspiratory time (Ti) and diaphragm activity (EMGdia). An increase in total breathing time (Ttot) was due exclusively to the increase in Te.

Methods Isolation, cultivation, and identification of hDPSCs were performed with morphological analyses and flow cytometry. The proliferation potential of \{DPSCs\} was evaluated with an \{XTT\} [(2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide)] assay. Media for the induction of dopaminergic and spinal motor neuronal differentiation were prepared. The efficacy of neural induction was evaluated by detecting the expression of neuron cell-specific cell markers in \{DPSCs\} by immunocytochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results In the \{XTT\} assay, there was a 2.6- or 2-fold decrease in \{DPSCs\} cultured in dopaminergic or motor neuronal inductive media, respectively. The proportions of βIII-tubulin (βIII-tub), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and oligodendrocyte (O1)-positive cells were significantly higher in \{DPSCs\} cultured in both neuronal inductive media compared with those cultured in control media. Furthermore, hDPSC-derived dopaminergic and spinal motor neuron cells after induction expressed a higher density of neuron cell markers than those before induction. Conclusion These findings suggest that in response to the neuronal inductive stimuli, a greater proportion of \{DPSCs\} stop proliferation and acquire a phenotype resembling mature neurons. Such neural crest-derived adult \{DPSCs\} may provide an alternative stem cell source for therapy-based treatments of neuronal disorders and injury. "

Many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease) appear to involve extensive axonal degeneration that often precedes somatic loss in affected neural populations. Axonal degeneration involves a number of intracellular pathways and characteristic changes in axon morphology (i.e., swelling, fragmentation, and loss). New method We describe a relatively simple set of methods to quantify the axonal degeneration using the 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxin model of \{PD\} in rats and a colchicine-induced model in primary rat neurons. Specifically, approaches are described that use the spaceballs stereological probe for tissue sections and petrimetrics stereological probe for cultured neurons, and image analysis techniques in both tissue sections and cultured neurons. Results These methods provide a mechanism for obtaining quantitative and semi-quantitative data to track the extent of axonal degeneration and may prove useful as outcome measures in studies aimed at preventing or slowing axonal degeneration in disease models. Comparison with existing methods Existing methods of quantification of axonal degeneration use densitometry and manual counts of axonal projections, but they do not utilize the random, unbiased systematic sampling approaches that are characteristic of stereological methods. The ImageJ thresholding analyses described here provide a descriptive method for quantifying the state of axonal degeneration. Conclusions These methods provide an efficient and effective means to quantify the extent and state of axonal degeneration in animal tissue and cultured neurons and can be used in other models for the same purposes.

Whether these structural changes in the tau protein are associated with pathogenic changes at the molecular and cellular level remains undetermined during the onset of AD. Here, we examined alterations in gene expression within individual \{NBM\} neurons immunostained for pS422, an early tau phosphorylation event, or dual labeled for pS422 and TauC3, a later stage tau neoepitope, from tissue obtained postmortem from subjects who died with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or mild/moderate AD. Specifically, pS422-positive pretangles displayed an upregulation of select gene transcripts subserving protein quality control. On the other hand, late-stage TauC3-positive \{NFTs\} exhibited upregulation of messenger \{RNAs\} involved in protein degradation but also cell survival. Taken together, these results suggest that molecular pathways regulating protein homeostasis are altered during the evolution of \{NFT\} pathology in the NBM. These changes likely contribute to the disruption of protein turnover and neuronal survival of these vulnerable \{NBM\} neurons during the progression of AD. "

The antioxidant ascorbic acid protects hippocampal pyramidal neurons against cell death during congenital lead exposure; however, critical functions like synaptic transmission, integration, and plasticity depend on preservation of dendritic and somal morphology. This study was designed to examine if ascorbic acid also protects neuronal morphology during developmental lead exposure. Timed pregnant rats were divided into four treatment groups: (1) control, (2) 100 mg/kg ascorbic acid once a day via gavage, (3) 0.05% lead acetate in drinking water, and (4) 0.05% lead + 100 mg/kg oral ascorbic acid. Brains of eight male pups (P25) per treatment group were processed for Golgi staining. Changes in hippocampal \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons’ somal size were estimated by cross-sectional area and changes in dendritic arborization by Sholl’s analysis. One-way \{ANOVA\} was used to compare results among treatment groups. Lead-exposed pups exhibited a significant decrease in somal size compared to controls (P &lt; 0.01) that was reversed by cotreatment with ascorbic acid. Sholl’s analysis revealed a significant increase in apical dendritic branch points near cell body (P &lt; 0.05) and a decreased total dendritic length in both apical and basal dendritic trees of \{CA1\} neurons (P &lt; 0.05). Ascorbic acid significantly but only partially reversed the somal and dendritic damage caused by developmental lead exposure. Oxidative stress thus contributes to lead neurotoxicity but other pathogenic mechanisms are also involved. "

Our study explored the effects of nesfatin-1 in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CNA) on the activity of gastric distention (GD)-sensitive neurons, gastric motility, and the potential regulation mechanisms by the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). Following retrograde injection of fluorogold (FG) into the DMV, we found that nesfatin-1/FG dual-labeled neurons were detected in the CNA, which indicates that some of the nesfatin-1-immunoreactive neurons arising from the \{DMV\} may project to the CNA. Single unit discharges in the \{CNA\} were recorded extracellularly, and gastric motility was monitored by implantation of a force transducer into the stomach of conscious rats. These results showed that nesfatin-1 administration to the \{CNA\} excited most of the GD-excitatory neurons, inhibited GD-inhibitory neurons, and dose-dependently reduced gastric motility. All of the above effects induced by nesfatin-1 could be partially blocked by pretreatment with the melanocortin 3/4 receptors antagonist, SHU9119. Electrical stimulation of the \{DMV\} excited the majority of the nesfatin-1-responsive \{GD\} neurons in the CNA. Additionally, pretreatment with an anti-NUCB2/nesfatin-1 antibody in the \{CNA\} increased the firing rate of nesfatin-1-responsive GD-inhibitory neurons but decreased the firing rate in nesfatin-1-responsive GD-excitatory neurons following electrical stimulation of the DMV. Finally, a subdiaphragmatic vagotomy eliminated the diminished gastric motility induced by nesfatin-1 injection. Taken together, these findings suggest that nesfatin-1 regulates the activity of GD-sensitive neurons and gastric motility via the melanocortin pathway in the CNA. Furthermore, the \{DMV\} may be involved in this regulatory pathway. "

In the unlesioned contralateral striatum and nucleus accumbens surprisingly high numbers of resident GFP-positive neurons (about 2653 and 422 per striatum and accumbens, respectively) were observed while only much lower TH-positive neurons (about 214 and 102 per striatum and accumbens, respectively) were detectable. In the lesioned hemisphere the number of \{GFP\} neurons was slightly increased already at day 4 by 16% and more at day 40 by 47% while the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons was dramatically increased by 848% at day 4 and by 1139% at day 40 over the control side. Additionally and particularly pronounced in the nucleus accumbens, GFP-positive neurons demonstrated increased sprouting of their projections over time, stronger than observed by TH-immunostaining. The load in \{TH\} protein may be essentially determined by post-transcriptional suppression/degradation while \{GFP\} may rather reflect the gross transcriptional activity.

The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that \{DA\} is synthesized by monoenzymatic neurons, i.e. l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), which produced in the monoenzymatic \{TH\} neurons is transported in the monoenzymatic \{AADC\} neurons for \{DA\} synthesis. Incubation of \{MBH\} in Krebs-Ringer solution with l-leucine, a competitive inhibitor of l-DOPA uptake, was used to prevent a hypothetical l-DOPA capture into AADC-containing neurons. Incubation of the substantia nigra containing DA-ergic neurons under the same conditions served as the control. According to our data, the l-leucine administration provoked a decrease of \{DA\} concentration in \{MBH\} and in the incubation medium but not in the substantia nigra and respective incubation medium, showing a decrease of cooperative synthesis of \{DA\} in MBH. This conclusion was supported by an observation of higher concentration of l-DOPA in the incubation medium under perfusion of \{MBH\} with Krebs-Ringer solution containing tolcapone, an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, and l-leucine than under perfusion with the same solution, but without l-leucine. Functional interaction between monoenzymatic \{TH\} and \{AADC\} neurons was indirectly confirmed by finding in electron microscopy their close relations in MBH. Besides monoenzymatic \{AADC\} neurons, any AADC-possessing neurons, catecholaminergic and serotoninergic, apparently, could participate in \{DA\} synthesis together with monoenzymatic \{TH\} neurons. This idea was confirmed by the observation of close topographic relations between monoenzymatic \{TH\} neurons and those containing both enzymes, i.e. DA-ergic, noradrenergic or adrenergic. Thus, monoenzymatic neurons possessing \{TH\} or \{AADC\} and being in close topographic relations can synthesize \{DA\} in cooperation. "

Herein we reveal that, in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), \{SGCs\} do express \{TLR4\} but this expression is inhibited by direct contact with neurons. Thus, \{TLR4\} mRNA and protein is strongly up-regulated in isolated \{DRG\} glial cells in the absence of neurons. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) mRNA expression with greater efficacy in \{DRG\} glial cell cultures than in mixed \{DRG\} cell cultures containing TLR4-positive neurons. Using an insert co-culture system, we have shown that neuronal inhibition of glial cell \{TLR4\} is likely to be dependent on cell–cell contact rather than diffusible factors from neurons. \{LPS\} stimulated prostaglandin \{E2\} (PGE2) production from \{DRG\} glial cells in a TLR4- and COX-2-dependent manner. In addition, exogenous \{PGE2\} potentiated LPS-stimulated COX-2 mRNA while inhibiting TNFα mRNA expression by \{DRG\} cells, suggestive of a complex regulatory system to control inflammation within the DRG. In addition to LPS, conditioned medium from heat-shocked \{DRG\} neurons also increased COX-2 mRNA expression in \{DRG\} glial cells in a partially TLR4-dependent manner. We therefore hypothesize that neuronal suppression of glial \{TLR4\} activity is a protective mechanism to prevent uncontrolled inflammation within the DRG. Under conditions where \{DRG\} neuronal viability is compromised, \{DRG\} glial cells become responsive to \{PAMPs\} (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and \{DAMPs\} (danger-associated molecular patterns) and generate a range of classical inflammatory responses.

The model is comprised of a soma and a passive dendrite, and incorporates a morphological parameter that describes the area proportion occupied by soma. The threshold potential of somatic chamber is determined within a range of dVS/dt for different values of morphological parameter and internal coupling conductance. By analyzing the interactions of inward and outward membrane currents prior to spike initiation, the biophysical basis associated with each threshold dynamic has been identified. Based on the simulations, we conceptualize the threshold dynamics of neuron as the outward level of somatic net current at the perithreshold potentials. These results provide a detailed description about how the morphology and biophysics of neurons participate in their threshold dynamics, which could facilitate to interpret the modulatory mechanism of subthreshold electromagnetic fields as well as the biophysical basis of neural coding.

Fast synaptic inputs to viscerofugal neurons arise from other enteric neurons, but their sources are unknown. We aimed to describe the origins of synaptic inputs to viscerofugal neurons by mapping the locations of their cell bodies within the myenteric plexus. Viscerofugal neuron somata were retrogradely traced with 1,1′-didodecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) from colonic nerve trunks and impaled with microelectrodes, in longitudinal muscle/myenteric plexus preparations of the guinea-pig distal colon (39 impalements, n = 14). Thirty-eight viscerofugal neurons were uni-axonal and had the electrophysiological characteristics of myenteric S-neurons; one neuron was multipolar with AH-neuron electrophysiological characteristics. Depolarizing current pulses evoked either single- or multiple action potentials in viscerofugal neurons (range 1–25 spikes, 500 ms, 100–900 pA, 21 cells). Electrical stimulation of internodal strands circumferential to viscerofugal neurons evoked fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in 19/24 cells. Focal pressure-ejection of the nicotinic agonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP, 10 μm) directly onto viscerofugal nerve cell bodies evoked large depolarizations and action potentials (23 ± 10 mV, latency 350 ± 230 ms, 21/22 cells). \{DMPP\} was then focally applied to multiple sites, up to 3 mm from the recorded viscerofugal neuron, to activate other myenteric S-neurons. In a few sites in myenteric ganglia, \{DMPP\} evoked repeatable fast \{EPSPs\} in viscerofugal neurons (latency 300 ± 316 ms, 38/394 sites, 10 cells). The cellular sources of synaptic inputs to viscerofugal neurons were located both orally and aborally (19 oral, 19 aboral), but the amplitude of oral inputs was consistently greater than aboral inputs (13.1 ± 4.3 mV vs. 10.1 ± 4.8 mV, respectively, p &lt; 0.05, paired t-test, n = 6). Most impaled viscerofugal neurons were nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactive (20/27 cells tested). Thus, the synaptic connections onto viscerofugal neurons within the myenteric plexus suggest that multiple enteric neural pathways feed into intestino-intestinal reflexes, involving sympathetic prevertebral ganglia.

Using gluconate-based internal recording solutions, we investigated the properties of a LTS-induced slow afterdepolarization (sADP) observed in a subpopulation of \{PVT\} neurons recorded in brain slice preparations. This LTS-induced sADP required T-type Ca2+ channel opening, exhibited variable magnitudes between neurons and a voltage dependency with a maximum near −50 mV. The area under the sADP remained stable during control monitoring, but displayed gradual suppression in media where strontium replaced Ca2+. The sADP was suppressed following bath application of 2-APB or ML204, suggesting engagement of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)-like channels. Further investigation revealed a reversible suppression during bath applications of membrane permeable cannabinoid receptor (CBR) blockers rimonabant, \{AM630\} or \{SR144528\} suggesting the presence of both \{CB1Rs\} and CB2Rs. Similar results were achieved by intracellular, but not bath application of the membrane impermeant \{CB1R\} blocker hemopressin, suggesting an intracellular localization of CB1Rs. Data from pharmacologic manipulation of endocannabinoid biosynthetic pathways suggested 2-arachidonlyglycerol (2-AG) as the endogenous cannabinoid ligand, derived via hydrolysis of diacylglycerol (DAG), with the latter formed from the pathway involving phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D and phosphatic acid phosphohydrolase. The sADP suppression observed during recordings with pipettes containing LY294002, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, suggested a role for \{PI3kinase\} in the translocation of these TRPC-like channels to the plasma membrane. Drug-induced attenuation of the availability of 2-AG influences the number of action potentials that surmount the \{LTS\} evoked in \{PVT\} neurons, implying an ongoing intracellular \{CBR\} modulation of neuronal excitability during LTS-induced bursting behavior.

The existence of a defined anatomo-functional organization within different segments of the same region is controversial. The presence of multiple motor representations in the primary motor area and in the parietal lobe interconnected by parieto-frontal circuits, which are widely overlapped, form a complex organization. Both features support the recovery of functions after brain injury. Regarding the movement organization, it is possible to yield a relevant impact through the understanding of actions and intentions of others, which is mediated by the activation of mirror-neuron systems. The implementation of cognitive functions (observation, image of the action and imitation) from the acute treatment phase allows the activation of motor representations without having to perform the action and it plays an important role in learning motor patterns.

Intrathecal injection of \{CXCL1\} neutralizing antibody or \{CXCR2\} antagonist \{SB225002\} attenuated CFA-induced mechanical and heat hypersensitivity on post-CFA day 3. Patch-clamp recordings showed that \{CXCL1\} potentiated NMDA-induced currents in lamina \{II\} neurons via CXCR2, and this potentiation was further increased in CFA-treated mice. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of \{CXCL1\} increased COX-2 expression in dorsal horn neurons, which was blocked by pretreatment with \{SB225002\} or \{MEK\} (ERK kinase) inhibitor PD98059. Finally, pretreatment with \{SB225002\} or \{PD98059\} decreased CFA-induced heat hyperalgesia and COX-2 mRNA/protein expression and \{ERK\} activation in the spinal cord.

Aβ1-42 caused neuronal death as demonstrated by lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) release, which was completely prevented by a pretreatment with \{PC\} in a dose-dependent manner. \{PC\} containing unsaturated long-chain acyl groups, 1,2-dioleoyl-PC (DOPC), also prevented neuronal death caused by Aβ1-42. The oleic acid ethyl-ester (OAEE) partially prevented Aβ1-42-induced neurotoxicity. Neurons that were pretreated with \{DOPC\} or \{OAEE\} for 24 h, washed out, and exposed to Aβ1-42 in the absence of either of these reagents, were still resistant to Aβ1-42-induced neurotoxicity. In contrast, treatment with phosphotidylserine (PS) or docosahexaenoic acid etyl-ester (DHAEE) had no protective effect on neurons against Aβ1-42-induced damage. These results suggest that the control of cellular \{PC\} content, not \{PS\} content, may prove useful in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease. "

In turn, excessive \{ROS\} damage mitochondrial function, which is linked to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. One possible path to prevent oxidative stress could be achieved by reducing mitochondrial respiration in favor of less efficient \{ATP\} production via glycolysis. Such a shift in energy metabolism is known as the ‘Warburg effect’. Geissoschizine methyl ether (GM) is one of the active components responsible for the psychotropic effects of Yokukansan, an herbal preparation widely used in China and Japan. Aim of the study \{GM\} protects neurons from glutamate-induced oxidative cytotoxicity through regulating mitochondrial function and suppressing \{ROS\} generation. We investigated the protective mechanism of \{GM\} against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in neuronal cells. Materials and methods The current study was performed on primary neurons and \{HT22\} cells, a hippocampus neuronal cell line. Cell viability was measured by Calcein \{AM\} assay. \{H2DCFDA\} staining was used for intracellular \{ROS\} measurement. \{GSH\} level was measured using the GSH-Glo™ luminescence-based assay. Mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were measured by the Seahorse Bioscience \{XFe\} 96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Protein levels were analyzed by western blot analysis. Results \{GM\} prevented glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in an HT-22 neuronal cell line even with a 9-hour exposure delay. \{GM\} blocked glutamate-induced intracellular \{ROS\} accumulation through suppressing mitochondrial respiration. Further, we found that \{GM\} up-regulated glycolysis and the pentose-phosphate pathway, which is involved in the production of intracellular reducing agent, NADPH. In addition, \{GM\} protected primary cortical neurons from both glutamate and buthioninesulfoximine toxicity. Conclusion \{GM\} prevents glutamate-induced oxidative damage through reducing mitochondrial respiration, which further suppresses \{ROS\} generation. In addition, \{GM\} up-regulates glycolysis which compensate for the energy depletion induced by mitochondrial respiration inhibition. Overall, our study is the first to report that \{GM\} protects neurons from oxidative toxicity by shifting energy metabolism from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis. "

Here we show that transganglionically transported cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) labels a distinct set of afferents in lamina I that are likely to correspond to Aδ nociceptors, and that most of these lack neuropeptides. The vast majority of lamina I projection neurons can be retrogradely labelled from the lateral parabrachial area, and these can be divided into 2 major groups based on expression of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1r). We show that CTb-labelled afferents form contacts on 43% of the spinoparabrachial lamina I neurons that lack the NK1r, but on a significantly smaller proportion (26%) of those that express the receptor. We also confirm with electron microscopy that these contacts are associated with synapses. Among the spinoparabrachial neurons that received contacts from CTb-labelled axons, contact density was considerably higher on NK1r-lacking cells than on those with the NK1r. By comparing the density of \{CTb\} contacts with those from other types of glutamatergic bouton, we estimate that nonpeptidergic Aδ nociceptors may provide over half of the excitatory synapses on some NK1r-lacking spinoparabrachial cells. These results provide further evidence that synaptic inputs to dorsal horn projection neurons are organised in a specific way. Taken together with previous studies, they suggest that both NK1r+ and NK1r-lacking lamina I projection neurons are directly innervated by Aδ nociceptive afferents. "

We have showed that blockade of 5-HT2A receptors in the periphery inhibits repeated inflammation-induced pain hypersensitivity. The present study investigated whether inhibition of 5-HT2A receptor signaling at the site of inflammation could inhibit repeated inflammation-induced neurochemical changes in spinal dorsal horn neurons. Treatment with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (20 μg) in the hindpaw following intraplantar injection of carrageenan inhibited the increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) reactivity, a marker of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), in the spinal dorsal horn. Administration of formalin (1%) in the hindpaw following the carrageenan injection evoked a great increase in NADPH-d reactivity in spinal dorsal horn neurons on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides. These changes were abolished by the pretreatment of ketanserin (20 μg). The ketanserin treatment also reduced the repeated inflammation-induced expression of protein kinase gamma (PKCγ) in the membrane of spinal dorsal horn neurons and increased PKCγ protein level in the cytosol. Following the treatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone methiodide (5 mg/kg, s.c.), the administration of ketanserin failed to inhibit the repeated inflammation-induced increase in NADPH-d reactivity and c-Fos expression in the spinal dorsal horn. These results suggest that 5-HT2A receptor bioactivity in the inflammatory site plays an important role in repeated inflammation-induced central sensitization. The present study supports the notion that targeting 5-HT2A receptors in the periphery can be a promising therapy for relieving chronic inflammatory pain. "

Our prior study showed that \{PGE2\} or \{EP4\} agonist stimulates \{EP4\} externalization and this event was not only suppressed by the inhibitor of anterograde export, but also by the recycling inhibitor (St-Jacques and Ma, 2013). These data suggest that \{EP4\} recycling also contributes to agonist-enhanced \{EP4\} surface abundance. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis using antibody-feeding-based internalization assay, recycling assay and FITC-PGE2 binding assay. We observed that selective \{EP4\} agonist 1-hydroxy-PGE1 (1-OH-PGE1) or \{CAY10850\} time- and concentration-dependently increased \{EP4\} internalization in cultured \{DRG\} neuron. Internalized \{EP4\} was predominantly localized in the early endosomes and recycling endosomes, but rarely in the late endosomes and lysosomes. These observations were confirmed by FITC-PGE2 binding assay. We further revealed that 1-OH-PGE1 or \{CAY10850\} time- and concentration-dependently increased \{EP4\} recycling. Double exposures to 1-OH-PGE1 induced a greater increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release than a single exposure or vehicle exposure, an event blocked by pre-treatment with the recycling inhibitor monensin. Our data suggest that \{EP4\} recycling contributes to agonist-induced cell surface abundance and consequently enhanced receptor sensitivity. Facilitating \{EP4\} externalization and recycling is a novel mechanism underlying PGE2-induced nociceptor sensitization. "

The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of the neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and locus coeruleus (LC), to analyze their role in determining reproductive senescence. Adult female Wistar rats in the diestrus phase (4 months/cyclic) and old females (18–20 months/acyclic) in persistent diestrus, were decapitated or perfused at three different time intervals (10, 14 and 18 h) throughout the day. In acyclic rats, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and noradrenaline (NE) content were reduced; Fos-related antigen (FRA) in \{AVPV\} and Fos-related antigen/Tyrosine hydroxylase (FRA/TH) in \{LC\} showed immunolabeling of a higher number of neurons in these animals. The 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol/noradrenaline (MHPG/NE) ratio was higher and plasma \{LH\} was lower in the acyclic rats. Furthermore, the estradiol level was higher, and the progesterone level was lower after 14 h of persistent diestrus. These findings suggested that during the periestropause, there was a higher level of POA/AVPV and \{NE\} neuronal activity in the \{LC\} of acyclic rats, associated with a lower capacity of synthesis and storage of neurotransmitters and neurohormones contributed to changes in the temporal pattern of neuroendocrine signaling, thereby compromising the accuracy of inhibitory and stimulatory effects, causing irregularity in the estrous cycle and determining reproductive senescence "

The existence of a defined anatomo-functional organization within different segments of the same region is controversial. The presence of multiple motor representations in the primary motor area and in the parietal lobe interconnected by parieto-frontal circuits, which are widely overlapped, form a complex organization. Both features support the recovery of functions after brain injury. Regarding the movement organization, it is possible to yield a relevant impact through the understanding of actions and intentions of others, which is mediated by the activation of mirror-neuron systems. The implementation of cognitive functions (observation, image of the action and imitation) from the acute treatment phase allows the activation of motor representations without having to perform the action and it plays an important role in learning motor patterns.

The \{SPNs\} of anuran amphibians form two cell columns segregated mainly in the lateral and medial marginal areas of the central gray matter. In the caecilian Typhlonectes natans immunoreactivity for galanin and ChAT is found in most laterally arranged neurons lying in spinal segments 2–7. They are encircled by TH- and nNOS-immunoreactive nerve fibers. These neurons might project specifically to a population of adrenergic sympathetic postganglionic neurons in paravertebral ganglia and/or non-adrenergic sympathetic postganglionic neurons in the celiac ganglia. However the segmental restriction and target specificity of the neurons of the species studied are not known. As mucous and granular glands in the dermis may represent one of the peripheral targets of the adrenergic ganglion cells and reflect the prominent preganglionic cell columns, an immunohistochemical study was done also on these glands. Retrograde-tracing studies are, however, needed to study the segmental localization of the preganglionic neurons and their projections to the postganglionic neurons in sympathetic ganglia. "

Mutations in \{PTEN\} have been found in a subset of individuals with autism and macrocephaly. Further, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) has been observed in patients with \{PTEN\} mutations prompting us to examine the role of Pten in neuronal migration. The dentate gyrus of PtenFlox/Flox mice was injected with Cre- and non-Cre-expressing retroviral particles, which integrate into the dividing genome to birthdate cells. Control and Pten knockout (KO) cell position in the granule cell layer was quantified over time to reveal that Pten \{KO\} neurons exhibit an aberrant migratory phenotype beginning at 7.5 days-post retroviral injection (DPI). We then assessed whether rapamycin, a mTor inhibitor, could prevent or reverse aberrant migration of granule cells. The preventative group received daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of rapamycin from 3 to 14 DPI, before discrepancies in cell position have been established, while the reversal group received rapamycin afterward, from 14 to 24 DPI. We found that rapamycin prevented and reversed somal hypertrophy. However, rapamycin prevented, but did not reverse aberrant migration in Pten \{KO\} cells. We also find that altered migration occurs through mTorC1 and not mTorC2 activity. Together, these findings suggest a temporal window by which rapamycin can treat aberrant migration, and may have implications for the use of rapamycin to treat PTEN-mutation associated disorders. Significance statement Mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) have been linked to a subset of individuals with autism and macrocephaly, as well as Cowden Syndrome and focal cortical dysplasia. Pten loss leads to neuronal hypertrophy, but the role of Pten in neuronal migration is unclear. Here we have shown that loss of Pten leads to aberrant migration, which can be prevented but not reversed by treatment with rapamycin, a mTor inhibitor. These results are important to consider as clinical trials are developed to examine rapamycin as a therapeutic for autism with \{PTEN\} mutations. Our findings show that some abnormalities cannot be reversed, and suggest the potential need for genetic screening and preventative treatment. "

This study investigated aspects of mitochondrial biology in spinal motor neurons from elderly subjects. We found that protein components of complex I of mitochondrial respiratory chain were reduced or absent in a proportion of aged motor neurons–a phenomenon not observed in fetal tissue. Further investigation showed that complex I-deficient cells had reduced mitochondrial \{DNA\} content and smaller soma size. We propose that mitochondrial dysfunction in these motor neurons could lead to the cell loss and ultimately denervation of muscle fibers. "

Although degeneration occurs in the spinal cord and muscle, the exact mechanism is not clear. Induced pluripotent stem cells from spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy patients provide a useful model for understanding the disease mechanism and designing effective therapy. Stem cells were generated from six patients and compared to control lines from three healthy individuals. Motor neurons from four patients were differentiated from stem cells and characterized to understand disease-relevant phenotypes. Stem cells created from patient fibroblasts express less androgen receptor than control cells, but show androgen-dependent stabilization and nuclear translocation. The expanded repeat in several stem cell clones was unstable, with either expansion or contraction. Patient stem cell clones produced a similar number of motor neurons compared to controls, with or without androgen treatment. The stem cell-derived motor neurons had immunoreactivity for HB9, Isl1, ChAT, and SMI-32, and those with the largest repeat expansions were found to have increased acetylated α-tubulin and reduced HDAC6. Reduced \{HDAC6\} was also found in motor neuron cultures from two other patients with shorter repeats. Evaluation of stably transfected mouse cells and \{SBMA\} spinal cord showed similar changes in acetylated α-tubulin and HDAC6. Perinuclear lysosomal enrichment, an \{HDAC6\} dependent process, was disrupted in motor neurons from two patients with the longest repeats. \{SBMA\} stem cells present new insights into the disease, and the observations of reduced androgen receptor levels, repeat instability, and reduced \{HDAC6\} provide avenues for further investigation of the disease mechanism and development of effective therapy.

However, substantial evidence has shown that a long-term overexpression of \{GDNF\} gene is often associated with side effects. We previously improved tetracycline (Tet)-On lentivirus system carrying human \{GDNF\} (hGDNF) gene, and demonstrated that hGDNF gene expression was tightly regulated and functional in vitro. Here we further examined the efficiency and neuroprotection of Tet-On lentivirus-mediated hGDNF gene regulation in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and a rat model of parkinsonism. The results showed that hGDNF gene expression was tightly regulated in transduced NPCs. Doxycycline (Dox)-induced hGDNF protected \{DA\} neurons from 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced toxicity in vitro. Intrastriatal injections of Tet-On lentivirus vectors resulted in dramatically increased levels of hGDNF protein in the striatum of rats with Dox-drinking water, when compared to lentivirus-injected and saline-injected rats with normal drinking water, respectively. In addition, hGDNF protected nigral \{DA\} neurons and striatal \{DA\} fibers, and attenuated d-amphetamine-induced rotational asymmetry in the 6-OHDA lesioned rats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that hGDNF gene transfer by Tet-On lentivirus vectors is tightly regulated in rat brain, and Dox-induced hGDNF is functional in neuroprotection of nigral \{DA\} neurons in a rat model of parkinsonism.

However, molecular mechanism about effect of exercise is poorly unknown. In this study, we investigated effect of exercise in synapse and dendritic spine of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons on mice with PD. The C57BL/6J male mice (n = 40) were divided by sham group, sham-exercise treated group, 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated group, and MPTP-exercise treated group. For exercise treatment, the mice were put on the treadmill to run for 8 m/min, 30 min/day, and 5 times/week for 2 weeks. Coordination ability was checked by rota rod test. Expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), synaptophysin, and post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) was confirmed at substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum using western blotting, or immunohistochemistry. To check dendritic spine in striatum, we used Golgi staining. The results revealed that \{MPTP\} treated group displayed poor coordination ability compared with sham group. However, MPTP-exercise treated group showed good coordination ability compared with \{MPTP\} treated group. As well as, we also found that MPTP-exercise group increases expression of synaptophysin, PSD-95, TH, and dendritic spine in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and fibers than \{MPTP\} treated group (p &lt; 0.05). Our findings suggest that exercise may give beneficial effects to patients with \{PD\} by facilitating synaptic plasticity and increasing dendritic spines. "

A ubiquitous deletion of \{KCC3\} in mice leads to severe locomotor deficits similar to \{ACCPN\} patients. However, the underlying pathological mechanism leading to the disease remains unclear. Even though a recent study suggests that the neuropathic features of \{ACCPN\} are mostly due to neuronal loss of KCC3, the specific cell type responsible for the disease is still unknown. Here we established four tissue specific \{KCC3\} knockout mouse lines to explore the cell population origin of ACCPN. Our results showed that the loss of \{KCC3\} in parvalbumin-positive neurons led to significant locomotor deficit, suggesting a crucial role of these neurons in the development of the locomotor deficit. Interestingly, mice in which \{KCC3\} deletion was driven by the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) did not develop any phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nociceptive neurons targeted with Nav1.8-driven \{CRE\} and Schwann cells targeted with a desert hedgehog-driven \{CRE\} were not involved in the development of ACCPN. Together, these results establish that the parvalbumin-positive neuronal population is an important player in the pathogenic development of ACCPN. "

It is known that serotonin, a stress-related transmitter, is closely related with the regulation of stress responses in the brain and that serotonergic function is modulated by various factors, including estrogen, in both sexes. In the present study, to elucidate the effects of aging on stress responses in serotonergic neurons, we examined the expression levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; a marker of serotonergic neurons) in the dorsal, ventral and lateral parts of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in young and old intact male rats. In young males, repeated restraint stress significantly increased the number of TPH-positive cells in all subdivisions of the DRN. In contrast, the stress-induced increase in \{TPH\} expression was only observed in the ventral part of the \{DRN\} in old males. Pretreatment with an estrogen receptor β antagonist had no effect on the number of TPH-positive cells in the dorsal and lateral \{DRN\} in young stressed males, whereas the antagonist decreased the number of TPH-positive cells in all \{DRN\} subdivisions in old stressed males. Our results suggest that the effects of repeated stress exposure on the expression of \{TPH\} in serotonergic neurons in the \{DRN\} change with age and that estrogenic effects via estrogen receptor β on \{TPH\} expression in stressed old males differ from those in young males.

Pregnant Long-Evans rats were orally exposed to 0, 4, 40, or 400-μg/kg \{BPA\} in corn oil throughout pregnancy. From postnatal days 1 to 9, pups were given daily oral doses of oil or BPA, at doses corresponding to those given during gestation. Brains were examined in adulthood, and the volume of layers 2/3 and layers 5/6 of the mPFC was parcellated. The density of neurons and glia in these layers was quantified stereologically with the optical disector, and density was multiplied by volume for each animal. Males exposed to 400-μg/kg \{BPA\} were found to have increased numbers of neurons and glia in layers 5/6. Although there were no significant effects of \{BPA\} in layers 2/3, the pattern of increased neuron number in males exposed to 400-μg/kg \{BPA\} was similar to that seen in layers 5/6. No effects of \{BPA\} were seen in females or in males exposed to the other doses of BPA. This study indicates that males are more susceptible to the long-lasting effects of \{BPA\} on anatomy of the mPFC, an area implicated in neurological disorders. "

We show that amphetamine, an addictive psychostimulant, and haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic drug, increase the phosphorylation of \{H3\} at \{S28\} and that this effect occurs in the context of H3K27me3. The increases in \{H3K27me3S28p\} occur in distinct populations of projection neurons located in the striatum, the major component of the basal ganglia. Genetic inactivation of the protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor, dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32), reduces the phosphorylation of \{H3K27me3S28\} produced by amphetamine and haloperidol. In contrast, knockout of the mitogen- and stress activated kinase 1 (MSK1), which is implicated in the phosphorylation of histone H3, decreases the effect of amphetamine, but not that of haloperidol. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that amphetamine and haloperidol increase the phosphorylation of H3K27me3S28 at the promoter regions of Atf3, Npas4 and Lipg, three genes repressed by PcG. These results identify \{H3K27me3S28p\} as a potential mediator of the effects exerted by amphetamine and haloperidol, and suggest that these drugs may act by re-activating PcG repressed target genes.

During hypoxia the neuronal cytoskeleton is rapidly reorganized and such abnormalities are directly linked to adverse outcomes. Besides their roles as master regulators of the cytoskeleton, the Rho \{GTPases\} are also involved in cellular processes stimulated by hypoxic stress. We investigated the contribution of Rac1-mediated signaling to hypoxic responses of mature neurons using primary cortical cells cultured for 17 days in vitro. We show Rac1 is both upregulated and activated during hypoxia. Pharmacological inhibition of Rac1, but not RhoA, completely abrogated hypoxic HIF-1α stabilization and expression of the HIF-1 targets \{VEGF\} and GLUT1. Furthermore activity of \{JNK\} and GSK3β were also highly dependent on Rac1 activity and biphasic effects were observed after 6 and 24 h of exposure. Notably, inhibition of either pathway suppressed HIF-1α accumulation. Although inhibition of Rac1 did not affect neuronal viability during acute exposure cell death was strongly induced after 24 h revealing a time-dependent effect of Rac1 signaling on survival. Thus hypoxia-activated Rac1 is critical for neuronal HIF-1α stabilization and survival during oxygen deprivation via integration of complex signaling cascades. "

Its regulatory actions are mediated by a subpopulation of kisspeptin neurons within the arcuate nucleus with co-expression of \{NKB\} and dynorphin A (commonly called the “KNDy neurons”). By forming an “autosynaptic feedback loop” within the hypothalamus, the \{KNDy\} neurons can modulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility and subsequent \{LH\} release in the pituitary. \{NKB\} regulation of \{LH\} secretion has been recently demonstrated in zebrafish, suggesting that the reproductive functions of \{NKB\} may be conserved from fish to mammals. Interestingly, the \{TAC3\} genes in fish not only encode the mature peptide of \{NKB\} but also a novel tachykinin-like peptide, namely NKB-related peptide (or neurokinin F). Recent studies in zebrafish also reveal that the neuroanatomy of TAC3/kisspeptin system within the fish brain is quite different from that of mammals. In this article, the current ideas of “KNDy neuron” model for GnRH regulation and steroid feedback, other reproductive functions of \{NKB\} including its local actions in the gonad and placenta, the revised model of tachykinin evolution from invertebrates to vertebrates, as well as the emerging story of the two \{TAC3\} gene products in fish, \{NKB\} and NKB-related peptide, will be reviewed with stress on the areas with interesting questions for future investigations.

Majority of the studies (n = 9) reported reduced \{MNA\} in patients. Two each reported either increased \{MNA\} or mixed (both increased and decreased) results, while only one study reported normal findings. Reduced \{MNA\} was associated with greater negative symptoms and theory of mind deficits. The neurophysiological technique, task paradigms used, specific brain regions studied and laterality did not influence these findings. Further, we propose an overarching model to understand the heterogeneous symptom dimensions of schizophrenia, in which an inherent mirror system deficit underlying persistent negative symptoms, social cognition impairments and self-monitoring deficits triggers a pathological metaplastic reorganization of this system resulting in aberrant excessive \{MNA\} and the phasic catatonic symptoms, affective instability and hallucinations.

In this study, we identified a novel functional role for ghrelin in modulating P-type Ca2 + channel (P-type channel) currents (IBa) as well as action-potential firing in rat Purkinje neurons. Our results show that ghrelin at 0.1 μM reversibly decreased \{IBa\} by ~ 32.3%. This effect was growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a)-dependent and was associated with a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of inactivation. Intracellular application of GDP-β-S and pretreatment with pertussis toxin abolished the inhibitory effects of ghrelin. Dialysis of cells with the peptide \{QEHA\} (but not the scrambled peptide SKEE), and a selective antibody raised against the G-protein αo subunit both blocked the ghrelin-induced response. Ghrelin markedly increased protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and intracellular application of \{PKI\} 5-24 as well as pretreatment of the cells with the \{PKA\} inhibitor KT-5720 abolished ghrelin-induced \{IBa\} decrease, while inhibition of \{PKC\} had no such effects. At the cellular level, ghrelin induced a significant increase in action-potential firing, and blockade of GHS-R1a by BIM-28163 abolished the ghrelin-induced hyperexcitability. In summary, these results suggest that ghrelin markedly decreases \{IBa\} via the activation of GHS-R1a, which is coupled sequentially to the activities of Go-protein βγ subunits and the downstream \{PKA\} pathway. This could contribute to its physiological functions, including the spontaneous firing of action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. "

In humans and animal models, aberrant excitatory connections that form after \{TBI\} may contribute to the pathogenesis of post-traumatic epilepsy. Partial neocortical isolation (“undercut” or “UC”) leads to altered neuronal circuitry and network hyperexcitability recorded in vivo and in brain slices from chronically lesioned neocortex. Recent data suggest a critical period for maladaptive excitatory circuit formation within the first 3 days post \{UC\} injury (Graber and Prince 1999, 2004; Li et al. 2011, 2012b). The present study focuses on alterations in excitatory connectivity within this critical period. Immunoreactivity (IR) for growth-associated protein (GAP)-43 was increased in the \{UC\} cortex 3 days after injury. Some GAP-43-expressing excitatory terminals targeted the somata of layer V pyramidal (Pyr) neurons, a domain usually innervated predominantly by inhibitory terminals. Immunocytochemical analysis of pre- and postsynaptic markers showed that putative excitatory synapses were present on somata of these neurons in \{UC\} neocortex. Excitatory postsynaptic currents from \{UC\} layer V Pyr cells displayed properties consistent with perisomatic inputs and also reflected an increase in the number of synaptic contacts. Laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) experiments demonstrated reorganized excitatory connectivity after injury within the UC. Concurrent with these changes, spontaneous epileptiform bursts developed in \{UC\} slices. Results suggest that aberrant reorganization of excitatory connectivity contributes to early neocortical hyperexcitability in this model. The findings are relevant for understanding the pathophysiology of neocortical post-traumatic epileptogenesis and are important in terms of the timing of potential prophylactic treatments. "

Mice with 2K1C-induced hypertension had impaired long-term, but not short-term, memory. Dendritic complexity of \{CA1\} neurons and hippocampal neurogenesis were reduced by 2K1C-induced hypertension on post-operation day 28. Furthermore, 2K1C decreased the levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor, while blood vessel density and activation status of astrocytes and microglia were not affected. In conclusion, hypertension impairs hippocampus-associated long-term memory, dendritic arborization and neurogenesis, which may be caused by down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways.

However, recent studies have shown that \{KNDy\} neurons also project and terminate to tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons, suggesting a role in prolactin secretion. Moreover, there is a possibility that other neurosecretory dopaminergic neurons regulating prolactin secretion, such as periventricular hypophyseal dopaminergic (PHDA) neurons, may also be innervated by \{KNDy\} neurons. In the present study, by means of double immunohistochemistry and retrograde neural tracer, we examined whether \{KNDy\} neurons project directly to \{PHDA\} neurons that project to blood vessels, as well as to \{TIDA\} neurons. The results revealed that \{KNDy\} neurons are widely projecting to neurosecretory dopaminergic neurons of the \{PHDA\} and \{TIDA\} neurons in rats and mice. Secondary, presence of a major receptor for NKB, neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R), in \{PHDA\} and \{TIDA\} neurons was examined and it appeared that most \{TIDA\} and \{PHDA\} neurons possess NK3R. These findings indicate that, in rodents, \{KNDy\} neurons widely project to neurosecretory dopaminergic neurons distributed in the hypothalamus, and may affect them via the NKB-NK3R signaling pathway.

Furthermore, abnormalities in basic motor control, skilled motor gestures, and motor learning, are common in ASD. These characteristics have been attributed to a possible defect in the pre- and postnatal development of specific neural networks including the dentate-thalamo-cortical pathway, which is involved in motor learning, automaticity of movements, and higher cognitive functions. The current study utilized custom diolistic labeling and unbiased stereology to characterize morphological alterations in neurons of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum in developing rat pups exposed to abnormally high levels of the serotonergic agonist 5-methyloxytryptamine (5-MT) pre-and postnatally. Occurring in as many as 30% of autistic subjects, developmental hyperserotonemia (DHS) is the most consistent neurochemical finding reported in autism and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD. This exposure produced dramatic changes in dendritic architecture and synaptic features. We observed changes in the dendritic branching morphology which did not lead to significant differences (p &gt; 0.5) in total dendritic length. Instead, \{DHS\} groups presented with dendritic trees that display changes in arborescence, that appear to be short reaching with elaborately branched segments, presenting with significantly fewer (p &gt; 0.001) dendritic spines and a decrease in numeric density when compared to age-matched controls. These negative changes may be implicated in the neuropathological and functional/behavioral changes observed in ASD, such as delays in motor learning, difficulties in automaticity of movements, and deficits in higher cognitive functions.

The effects of rhynchophylline on expressions of GluN1 and GluN2B in primary hippocampal neurons in neonatal rats in vitro were investigated. Neonatal hippocampal neurons were cultured with neurobasal-A medium. After incubation for 6 h or 48 h with rhynchophylline (non-competitive \{NMDAR\} antagonist) and MK-801 (non-competitive \{NMDAR\} antagonist with anxiolytic effect, as the control drug) from day 6, neuron toxicity, mRNA and protein expressions of GluN1 and GluN2B were analyzed. GluN1 is mainly distributed on neuronal axons and dendritic trunks, cytoplasm and cell membrane near axons and dendrites. GluN2B is mainly distributed on the membrane, dendrites, and axon membranes. GluN1 and GluN2B are codistributed on dendritic trunks and dendritic spines. After 48 h incubation, a lower concentration of rhynchophylline (lower than 400 μmol/L) and MK-801 (lower than 200 μmol/L) have no toxicity on neonatal hippocampal neurons. Rhynchophylline up-regulated GluN1 mRNA expression at 6 h and mRNA and protein expressions at 48 h, but down-regulated GluN2B mRNA and protein expressions at 48 h. However, GluN1 and GluN2B mRNA expressions were down-regulated at 6 h, and mRNA and protein expressions were both up-regulated by MK-801 at 48 h.

Their progressive degeneration is associated with disease conditions, excessive noise exposure and aging. Replacement of ANs, which lack the ability to regenerate spontaneously, would have a significant impact on research and advancement in cochlear implants in addition to the amelioration of hearing impairment. The aim of this study was to induce a neuronal phenotype in endogenous non-neural cells in the cochlea, which is the essential organ of hearing. Overexpression of a neurogenic basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor, Ascl1, in the cochlear non-sensory epithelial cells induced neurons at high efficiency at embryonic, postnatal and juvenile stages. Moreover, induced neurons showed typical properties of neuron morphology, gene expression and electrophysiology. Our data indicate that Ascl1 alone or Ascl1 and NeuroD1 is sufficient to reprogram cochlear non-sensory epithelial cells into functional neurons. Generation of neurons from non-neural cells in the cochlea is an important step for the regeneration of \{ANs\} in the mature mammalian cochlea. "

In the present study, we examined whether \{NSAIDs\} modulate tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na+ channels and if this modulation depends on the extracellular pH. The TTX-R Na+ currents were recorded from small-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons by using a whole-cell patch clamp technique. Among eight \{NSAIDs\} tested in this study, several drugs, including aspirin and ibuprofen, did not affect TTX-R Na+ channels either at pH 7.4 or at pH 6.0. However, we found that indomethacin, and, to a lesser extent, ibuprofen and naproxen potently inhibited the peak amplitude of TTX-R Na+ currents at pH 6.0. The indomethacin-induced inhibition of TTX-R Na+ channels was more potent at depolarized membrane potentials. Indomethacin significantly shifted both the voltage-activation and voltage-inactivation relationships to depolarizing potentials at pH 6.0. Indomethacin accelerated the development of inactivation and retarded the recovery from inactivation of TTX-R Na+ channels at pH 6.0. Given that indomethacin and several other \{NSAIDs\} could further suppress local nociceptive signals by inhibiting TTX-R Na+ channels at an acidic pH in addition to the classical \{COX\} inhibition, these drugs could be particularly useful for the treatment of inflammatory pain.

The present study investigated the effects of \{DHA\} on the lipid peroxidation, the level of inflammatory cytokines and neuron apoptosis in the hippocampal neurons in high-glucose condition. High-glucose administration increased the level of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-6, induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in vitro. \{DHA\} treatment reduced oxidative stress and TNF-α expression, protected the hippocampal neurons by increasing \{AKT\} phosphorylation and decreasing caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression. These results suggested that high-glucose exposure induced injury of hippocampal neurons in vitro, and the principle mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effect of \{DHA\} were its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic potential. \{DHA\} may thus be of use in preventing or treating neuron-degeneration resulting from hyperglycemia.

However, little is known about the effects of post-treatment with \{CART\} during the neuronal recovery after \{OGD\} and reoxygenation in cultured primary cortical neurons. The present study was to investigate the role of \{CART\} treated after \{OGD\} injury in neurons. Primary mouse cortical neurons were subjected to \{OGD\} and then treated with CART. Our data show that post-treatment with \{CART\} reduced the neuronal apoptosis caused by \{OGD\} injury. In addition, \{CART\} repaired OGD-impaired cortical neurons by increasing the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), which promotes neurite outgrowth. This effect depends on pleiotrophin (PTN) as siRNA-mediated \{PTN\} knockdown totally abolished the increase in CART-stimulated \{GAP43\} protein levels. In summary, our findings demonstrate that \{CART\} repairs the neuronal injury after \{OGD\} by facilitating neurite outgrowth through PTN-dependent pathway. The role for \{CART\} in neurite outgrowth makes it a new potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. "

Cadmium has been reported to produce learning and memory dysfunctions and Alzheimer like symptoms, though the mechanism is unknown. On the other hand, cholinergic system in central nervous system (CNS) is implicated on learning and memory regulation, and it has been reported that cadmium can affect cholinergic transmission and it can also induce selective toxicity on cholinergic system at peripheral level, producing cholinergic neurons loss, which may explain cadmium effects on learning and memory processes if produced on central level. The present study is aimed at researching the selective neurotoxicity induced by cadmium on cholinergic system in CNS. For this purpose we evaluated, in basal forebrain region, the cadmium toxic effects on neuronal viability and the cholinergic mechanisms related to it on \{NS56\} cholinergic mourine septal cell line. This study proves that cadmium induces a more pronounced, but not selective, cell death on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) on cholinergic neurons. Moreover, \{MTT\} and \{LDH\} assays showed a dose dependent decrease of cell viability in \{NS56\} cells. The \{ACh\} treatment of \{SN56\} cells did not revert cell viability reduction induced by cadmium, but siRNA transfection against \{AChE\} partially reduced it.

In the presence of the autaptic connection, the p:q mode-locking behaviors are completely reset. The autapse extends the scope of mode-locking. The autapse can enhance or suppress the status of mode-locking. Even for some specified autaptic parameters, the neuron could be driven into the sub-threshold oscillation. Our results suggested that the autapse can serve as a potential control option for adjusting the mode-locking firing behaviors. We also found that changing the delay time is much more effectively operable to regulate the response behavior than the autaptic intensity. "

Material and Methods We determined the \{SMN1\} and \{SMN2\} copy number in genomic \{DNA\} samples from 391 Malian adult volunteers, 120 Yoruba from Nigeria, 120 Luyha from Kenya and 74 U.S. Caucasians using a Taqman quantitative \{PCR\} assay. We evaluated the \{SALS\} risk based on the estimated \{SMA\} protein level using the Veldink formula (SMN1 copy number + 0.2 ∗ \{SMN2\} copy number). We also characterized the disease natural history in 15 \{ALS\} patients at the teaching hospital of Point G, Bamako, Mali. Results We found that 131 of 391 (33.5%) had an estimated \{SMN\} protein expression of ≤ 2.2; 60 out of 391 (15.3%) had an estimated \{SMN\} protein expression &lt; 2 and would be at risk of \{ALS\} and the disease onset was as early as 16 years old. All 15 patients were male and some were physically handicapped within 1–2 years in the disease course. Conclusion Because of the short survival time of our patients, family histories and sample \{DNA\} for testing were not done. However, our results show that sporadic \{ALS\} is of earlier onset and shorter survival time as compared to patients elsewhere. We plan to establish a network of neurologists and researchers for early screening of ALS. "

Instead, microtubules serve as architectural elements within axons and dendrites and also act as railways for the transport of organelles. Molecular motors transport organelles along the microtubule, but can also transport the microtubules themselves and organize them into regionally distinct patterns. Motor and nonmotor microtubule-related proteins can influence the assembly and other properties of the microtubules as well as their interactions with various elements of the cytoplasm. Abnormalities of microtubule-related proteins can give rise to debilitating neuropathies. "

One of the main mechanisms involved is represented by expectations of clinical improvement which, in turn, have been found to either reduce anxiety or activate reward mechanisms. Therefore, the study of the placebo effect allows us to understand how emotions may affect both behavior and therapeutic outcome. The high rate of placebo responders in clinical trials of Parkinson's disease provided the motivation to investigate the biological underpinnings of the placebo response in Parkinsonian patients. The placebo effect in Parkinson's disease is induced through the administration of an inert substance which the patient believes to improve motor performance. By using this approach, different behavioral and neuroimaging studies have documented objective improvements in motor performance and an increase of endogenous dopamine release in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. Recently, single-neuron recording from the subthalamic and thalamic regions during the implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to investigate the firing pattern of different neurons before and after placebo administration. The results show that the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the ventral anterior thalamus are all involved in the placebo response in Parkinson patients, thus making intraoperative recording an excellent model to characterize the neuronal circuit that is involved in the placebo response in Parkinson's disease as well as in other disorders of movement.

Firstly, Rosenfeld's staining and immunofluorescence staining of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were used to address the difference of morphology in the mixed cultures and neuronal cultures. Our results showed that neurons and astrocytes grew in good conditions. The ratio of neurons and astrocytes in the mixed cultures was around 1:1, and the purity of neurons in the neuronal cultures is 91.3%. Furthermore, ketamine was used to test the hypothesis that the presence of a higher proportion of glia in the mixed cultures would be protective against ketamine-induced neurotoxicity in the mixed cultures compared with neuronal cultures. The results showed that ketamine-induced morphological changes, cell viability decrease and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels increase were significantly mitigated in neuron–glia mixed cultures compared with neuronal cultures. Furthermore, 2-PMPA was included to further explore efficient protective drug for ketamine-induced neurotoxicity. Our results showed that 2-PMPA reduced ketamine-induced decrease of cell viability and increase of \{LDH\} levels in the mixed cultures but not in the neuronal cultures. Further morphological changes of neurons and astrocytes also indicated that 2-PMPA could improve ketamine damaged neurons in the mixed cultures instead of neuronal cultures. These results indicate that glia protect neurons from ketamine-induced neurotoxicity. These data further suggest that glia mediate the neuroprotective effect of 2-PMPA and 2-PMPA has the potential to treat ketamine-induced neurotoxicity in vivo. Delineating the mechanisms underlying the communication between neurons and glia and the neuroprotective effects of 2-PMPA in the mixed cultures to ketamine-induced neurotoxicity require further investigation.

This shortfall can be resolved using repetition suppression paradigms that identify physiological adaptation processes caused by repeated activation of identical neuronal circuits. Here, event-related potentials were used to investigate the time course of mirror neuron circuit activation using repetition suppression within and across action observation and action execution modalities. In a lip-reading and speech production paradigm, the \{N170\} component indexed stimulus repetition by adapting to both cross-modal and intra-modal repetitions in the left hemisphere. Neuronal source localization revealed activation of the left inferior parietal lobule during cross-modal relative to intra-modal trials. These results provide support for the position that the same neuronal circuits are activated in perceiving and performing articulatory actions. Moreover, our data strongly suggest that inferior parietal lobule mirror neurons are activated relatively early in time, which indicates partly automatic processes of linguistic perception and mirroring. Repetition suppression paradigms therefore help to elucidate neuronal correlates of different cognitive processes and may serve as a starting point for advanced electrophysiological research on mirror neurons.

Microglias are the key cell type involved in innate immune responses in CNS, and microglia activation has been linked to inflammation and neurotoxicity. In this study, using ELISA, we showed that Arsenic trioxide up-regulated the expression and secretion of IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner and a time-dependent manner in cultured \{HAPI\} microglia cells. The secretion of IL-1β caused the apoptosis of SH-SY5Y. These pro-inflammatory responses were inhibited by the \{STAT3\} blocker, \{AG490\} and P38/JNK \{MAPK\} blockers SB202190, SP600125. Further, Arsenic trioxide exposure could induce phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, and the translocation of \{STAT3\} from the cytosol to the nucleus in this \{HAPI\} microglia cell line. Thus, the \{STAT3\} signaling pathway can be activated after Arsenic trioxide treatment. However, P38/JNK \{MAPK\} blockers SB202190, \{SP600125\} also obviously attenuated \{STAT3\} activation and transnuclear transport induced by Arsenic trioxide. In concert with these results, we highlighted that the secretion of IL-1β and \{STAT3\} activation induced by Arsenic trioxide can be mediated by elevation of P38/JNK \{MAPK\} in \{HAPI\} microglia cells and then induced the toxicity of neurons.

We also examined the relation between the medial frontal lobe and the rostral pontine reticular formation. Materials and Methods Continuous cystometry was performed in 28 female rats. After the interval between bladder contractions was shortened by noradrenaline injection in the medial frontal lobe we injected glutamate or flavoxate hydrochloride in the rostral pontine reticular formation or intravenously injected flavoxate or propiverine. The change in bladder activity was examined. Results Noradrenaline injection in the medial frontal lobe shortened the interval between bladder contractions. In contrast to the bladder contraction interval before and after noradrenaline injection in the medial frontal lobe, the interval was prolonged after noradrenaline injection when glutamate or flavoxate was injected in the rostral pontine reticular formation, or flavoxate was injected intravenously. Noradrenaline injection in the medial frontal lobe plus intravenous propiverine injection also prolonged the interval compared to that after noradrenaline injection alone. However, the interval after noradrenaline injection in the medial frontal lobe plus intravenous injection of propiverine was shorter than that before noradrenaline injection only. Conclusions Medial frontal lobe neurons excited by noradrenaline may facilitate the micturition reflex via activation of inhibitory interneurons, which inhibit descending rostral pontine reticular formation neurons that innervate the lumbosacral glycinergic inhibitory neurons. Therefore, the mechanism of micturition reflex facilitation by the activation of medial frontal lobe neurons involves the rostral pontine reticular formation. "

Synaptic \{GABAA\} α4 receptors are localized at the synapse and mediate phasic inhibitory neurotransmission, while extrasynaptic \{GABAA\} receptors are located outside of the synapse and mediate tonic inhibitory transmission. These receptors have distinct pharmacological and biophysical properties that contribute to interest in how these different subtypes are regulated under physiological and pathological states. We utilized subcellular fractionation procedures to separate these populations of receptors in order to investigate their regulation by protein kinases in cortical cultured neurons. Protein kinase A (PKA) activation decreases synaptic α4 expression while protein kinase C (PKC) activation increases α4 subunit expression, and these effects are associated with increased β3 S408/409 or γ2 \{S327\} phosphorylation respectively. In contrast, \{PKA\} activation increases extrasynaptic α4 and δ subunit expression, while \{PKC\} activation has no effect. Our findings suggest synaptic and extrasynaptic \{GABAA\} α4 subunit expression can be modulated by \{PKA\} to inform the development of more specific therapeutics for neurological diseases that involve deficits in \{GABAergic\} transmission.

One important issue we wished to address is whether dopaminergic precursors/neurons manufactured by our GMP-compatible process can be cryopreserved and engrafted in animal Parkinson disease (PD) models. Methods In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of freshly prepared and cryopreserved dopaminergic neurons in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat \{PD\} model. Results We showed functional recovery up to 6 months post-transplantation in rats transplanted with our cells, whether freshly prepared or cryopreserved. In contrast, no motor improvement was observed in two control groups receiving either medium or cells at a slightly earlier stage (day 10 after \{NSC\} stage). Histologic analysis at the end point of the study (6 months post-transplantation) showed robust long-term survival of donor-derived tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ dopaminergic neurons in rats transplanted with day 14 dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, TH+ fibers emanated from the graft core into the surrounding host striatum. Consistent with the behavioral analysis, no or few TH+ neurons were detected in animals receiving day 10 cells, although human cells were present in the graft. Importantly, no tumors were detected in any grafted rats, but long-term tumorigenic studies will need to determine the safety of our products.

Adult \{SD\} rats were randomly divided into two groups: propofol group (0.9 mg kg−1 min−1, 2 h via a tail vein catheter) and control group. All the rats were tested for working memory performances in a Y-maze-rewarded alternation task (a task of delayed non-matched-to-sample) at 24, 48, 72 h after propofol anesthesia, and the behavior results of \{WM\} tasks were recorded at the same time. Spatio-temporal trains of action potentials were obtained from the original signals. Single neuron activity was characterized by peri-event time histograms analysis and neuron ensemble activities were characterized by Granger causality to describe the interactions within the neuron ensemble. The results show that: comparing with the control group, the percentage of neurons excited and related to \{WM\} was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01 in 24 h, p &lt; 0.05 in 48 h); the interactions within neuron ensemble were significantly weakened (p &lt; 0.01 in 24 h, p &lt; 0.05 in 48 h), whereas no significant difference in 72 h (p &gt; 0.05), which were consistent with the behavior results.

At 7 weeks of age, \{NPC1\} mutants showed a distinct olfactory impairment in an olfactory test compared with age-matched wild-type controls (WT). The marked loss of olfactory sensory neurons within the \{NPC1\} affected olfactory bulb (NPC1-OB) suggests that \{NPC1\} dysfunction impairs olfactory structure. Furthermore, the pool of neuroblasts in the \{OB\} was diminished in \{NPC1\} mice despite the intact proliferative capacity of neural stem/progenitor cells in the subventricular zone. Instead, pro-inflammatory proliferating microglia accumulated extensively in the NPC1-OB as the disease progressed. To evaluate the impact of abnormal microglial activation on olfaction in \{NPC1\} mice, a microglial inhibition study was performed using the anti-inflammatory agent Cyclosporin A (CsA). Importantly, long-term CsA treatment in \{NPC1\} mice reduced reactive microgliosis, restored the survival of newly generated neurons in the \{OB\} and improved overall performance on the olfactory test. Therefore, our study highlights the possible role of microglia in the regulation of neuronal turnover in the \{OB\} and provides insight into the possible therapeutic applications of microglial inhibition in the attenuation or reversal of olfactory impairment.

Multiple cellular, molecular and biochemical changes impact the development and outcome of TBI. Neuronal cell apoptosis, which is an important pathological change in secondary brain damage, is crucial to determine the functional recovery after TBI. miR-21, a widely-reported oncogene, which can reduce cell apoptosis in cancer, has been confirmed to be a pronounced up-regulated miRNA after \{TBI\} in animal model. Our study is designed to investigate whether miR-21 has the function of antiapoptosis in experimental \{TBI\} model in vitro and to explore the possible regulatory mechanism of miR-21 on neuronal apoptosis. The scratch cell injury was performed to mimic TBI-induced apoptosis in neurons, and miR-21 agomir/antagomir was transfected to up-/down-regulate the miR-21 level. Our data suggests that miR-21 can reduce the number of TUNEL-positive neurons. Meanwhile, miR-21 decreased the expression level of PTEN, and increased the phosphorylation of Akt significantly. In neurons transfected with miR-21 agomir, the expression of Bcl-2 was promoted while the caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax level were down-regulated, which are crucially the downstream apoptosis-related proteins of PTEN-Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, miR-21 can exert the function of reducing neuronal apoptosis through activating the PTEN-Akt signaling pathway. Our research provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal apoptosis following TBI, which reminds that miR-21may be a potential therapeutic target for \{TBI\} treatment. "

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed to evaluate \{MKK4\} S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation. Neuronal loss was observed using histological detection.

However, application of the exogenous \{NO\} donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GNSO), an inhibitor of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist \{MK801\} diminished I/R-induced S-nitrosylation and phosphorylation. These compounds also markedly decreased cerebral I/R-induced degeneration and death of neurons in hippocampal \{CA1\} region in rats. Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time, that cerebral ischemia/reperfusion can induce S-nitrosylation of MKK4.

In rat cortical neurons, leptin elicited neuroprotective effects against NMDA-induced cell death, which were concentration-dependent (10–100 ng/ml) and largest when the adipokine was preincubated for 2 h before the neurotoxic stimulus. In both rat and mouse cortical neurons, leptin-induced neuroprotection was fully antagonized by paxilline (Pax, 0.01–1 μM) and iberiotoxin (Ibtx, 1–100 nM), with \{EC50s\} of 38 ± 10 nM and 5 ± 2 nM for Pax and Ibtx, respectively, close to those reported for Pax- and Ibtx-induced Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ channels (Slo1 \{BK\} channels) blockade; the \{BK\} channel opener \{NS1619\} (1–30 μM) induced a concentration-dependent protection against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Moreover, cortical neurons from mice lacking one or both alleles coding for Slo1 \{BK\} channel pore-forming subunits were insensitive to leptin-induced neuroprotection. Finally, leptin exposure dose-dependently (10–100 ng/ml) increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in rat cortical neurons. In conclusion, our results suggest that Slo1 \{BK\} channel activation following increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels is a critical step for leptin-induced neuroprotection in NMDA-exposed cortical neurons in vitro, thus highlighting leptin-based intervention via \{BK\} channel activation as a potential strategy to counteract neurodegenerative diseases.

Early down-regulation of cannabinoid \{CB1\} receptor expression on \{MSN\} (CB1(MSN)) is thought to participate in \{HD\} pathogenesis. Here we present a cell-specific genetic rescue of CB1(MSN) in R6/2 mice and report that treatment prevents the reduction of excitatory synaptic markers in the striatum (synaptophysin, vGLUT1 and vGLUT2), of dendritic spine density on \{MSNs\} and of \{MSN\} sEPSCs, but does not prevent motor impairment. We conclude that loss of excitatory striatal synapses in \{HD\} mice is controlled by CB1(MSN) and can be uncoupled from the motor phenotype. "

Recently, several studies have shown that yokukansan has a neuroprotective effect. The aim of this study was to examine the neuroprotective effect of yokukansan on hippocampal neurons from embryonic mouse brain against the effects of corticosterone, which is considered to be a stress hormone and to be cytotoxic toward neurons. The cell survival rates were measured by the WST-8 assay and \{LDH\} assay. Twenty-four hours after treatment with corticosterone, cell numbers were significantly decreased compared with the control or treatment with vehicle in a dose-dependent manner. When cells were treated with 30 μM corticosterone, the decrease in the number of cells was significantly recovered by treatment with yokukansan (100–1000 μg/ml) in a dose-dependent manner. However, yokukansan did not suppress the decrease in cell numbers that was induced by treatment with 100 μM corticosterone. In the \{LDH\} assay, treatment with yokukansan at a high concentration (500–1000 μg/ml) suppressed the \{LDH\} concentration induced by treatment with both 30 μM and 100 μM corticosterone compared to treatment with corticosterone alone, respectively. These results suggest that yokukansan protects against the cytotoxic effect of a low concentration of corticosterone on hippocampal neurons. "

abstract = "Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with increased amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to β-amyloid peptides (Aβ), cholinergic neuron loss with decreased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, and cognitive dysfunction. Both 69-kDa ChAT and 82-kDa ChAT are expressed in cholinergic neurons in human brain and spinal cord with 82-kDa ChAT localized predominantly to neuronal nuclei, suggesting potential alternative functional roles for the enzyme. By gene microarray analysis, we found that 82-kDa ChAT-expressing \{IMR32\} neural cells have altered expression of genes involved in diverse cellular functions. Importantly, genes for several proteins that regulate \{APP\} processing along amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways are differentially expressed in 82-kDa ChAT-containing cells. The predicted net effect based on observed changes in expression patterns of these genes would be decreased amyloidogenic \{APP\} processing with decreased Aβ production. This functional outcome was verified experimentally as a significant decrease in \{BACE1\} protein levels and activity and a concomitant reduction in the release of endogenous Aβ1–42 from neurons cultured from brains of AD-model APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The expression of 82-kDa ChAT in neurons increased levels of GGA3, which is involved in trafficking \{BACE1\} to lysosomes for degradation. shRNA-induced decreases in \{GGA3\} protein levels attenuated the 82-kDa ChAT-mediated decreases in \{BACE1\} protein and activity and Aβ1–42 release. Evidence that 82-kDa ChAT can enhance \{GGA3\} gene expression is shown by enhanced \{GGA3\} gene promoter activity in \{SN56\} neural cells expressing this ChAT protein. These studies indicate a novel relationship between cholinergic neurons and \{APP\} processing, with 82-kDa ChAT acting as a negative regulator of Aβ production. This decreased formation of Aβ could result in protection for cholinergic neurons, as well as protection of other cells in the vicinity that are sensitive to increased levels of Aβ. Decreasing levels of 82-kDa ChAT due to increasing age or neurodegeneration could alter the balance towards increasing Aβ production, with this potentiating the decline in function of cholinergic neurons.

Within the last decade, the engineering of mouse models of lower motor neuron diseases has facilitated the development of new therapeutic scenarios aimed at delaying or reversing the progression of these conditions. In this context, motor end plates (MEPs) are highly specialized regions on the skeletal musculature that offer minimally invasive access to the pre-synaptic nerve terminals, henceforth to the spinal cord motor neurons. Transgenic technologies can take advantage of the relationship between the \{MEP\} regions on the skeletal muscles and the corresponding motor neurons to shuttle therapeutic genes into specific compartments within the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The first aim of this neuroanatomical investigation was to map the details of the organization of the \{MEP\} zones for the main muscles of the mouse hindlimb. The hindlimb was selected for the present work, as it is currently a common target to challenge the efficacy of therapies aimed at alleviating neuromuscular dysfunction. This \{MEP\} map was then used to guide series of intramuscular injections of Fluoro-Gold (FG) along the muscles’ \{MEP\} zones, therefore revealing the distribution of the motor neurons that supply them. Targeting the entire \{MEP\} regions with \{FG\} increased the somatic availability of the retrograde tracer and, consequently, gave rise to FG-positive motor neurons that are organized into rostro-caudal columns spanning more spinal cord segments than previously reported. The results of this investigation will have positive implications for future studies involving the somatic delivery and retrograde transport of therapeutic transgenes into affected motor neurons. These data will also provide a framework for transgenic technologies aiming at maintaining the integrity of the neuromuscular junction for the treatment of lower motor neuron dysfunctions. "

Less is known about the participation of CaMKII in regulating \{VGCCs\} in resting cells. We examined constitutive CaMKII control of Ca2 + currents in peripheral sensory neurons acutely isolated from dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of adult rats. The small molecule CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (1.0 μM) reduced depolarization-induced \{ICa\} by 16–30% in excess of the effects produced by the inactive homolog KN-92. The specificity of CaMKII inhibition on \{VGCC\} function was shown by the efficacy of the selective CaMKII blocking peptide autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide in a membrane-permeable myristoylated form, which also reduced \{VGCC\} current in resting neurons. Loss of \{VGCC\} currents is primarily due to reduced N-type current, as application of mAIP selectively reduced N-type current by approximately 30%, and prior N-type current inhibition eliminated the effect of mAIP on VGCCs, while prior block of L-type channels did not reduce the effect of mAIP on total ICa. T-type currents were not affected by mAIP in resting \{DRG\} neurons. Transduction of sensory neurons in vivo by \{DRG\} injection of an adeno-associated virus expressing \{AIP\} also resulted in a loss of N-type currents. Together, these findings reveal a novel molecular adaptation whereby sensory neurons retain CaMKII support of \{VGCCs\} despite remaining quiescent. "

Furthermore, hypoxic exposure was performed in cultured cells, and the expression of endogenous α-crystallin and caspase-3 was assayed by Western blotting.

We previously reported the existence of a novel short isoform of Dp, Dp40, in adult mouse brain. However, the exact biochemical expression profile and cytological distribution of the Dp40 protein remain unknown. In this study, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the NH2-terminal region of the Dp40 and identified the expression profile of Dp40 in the mouse brain. Through an analysis using embryonic and postnatal mouse cerebrums, we found that Dp40 emerged from the early neonatal stages until adulthood, whereas Dp71, an another Dp short isoform, was highly detected in both prenatal and postnatal cerebrums. Intriguingly, relative expressions of Dp40 and Dp71 were prominent in cultured dissociated neurons and non-neuronal cells derived from mouse hippocampus, respectively. Furthermore, the immunocytological distribution of Dp40 was analyzed in dissociated cultured neurons, revealing that Dp40 is detected in the soma and its dendrites, but not in the axon. It is worthy to note that Dp40 is localized along the subplasmalemmal region of the dendritic shafts, as well as at excitatory postsynaptic sites. Thus, Dp40 was identified as a neuron-type Dp possibly involving dendritic and synaptic functions. "

Long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber-Purkinje neuron glutamatergic transmission is believed to be a cellular mechanism for motor learning and motor coordination in the cerebellum. Downregulated mRNA expression of calcineurin B, IP3-R1, myosin Va and \{PLC\} β4, which are required for the induction of cerebellar LTD, led to an impairment of \{LTD\} induction in Purkinje neurons of \{SCA3\} transgenic mouse. Our study suggested that ataxin-3-Q79 caused hypoacetylation of cerebellar histone \{H3\} or \{H4\} by inhibiting the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) without affecting the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC). Consistent with the hypothesis that hypoacetylated \{H3\} or \{H4\} histone associated with promoter regions of downregulated genes is the molecular mechanism underlying ataxin-3-Q79-induced transcriptional repression, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative real-time \{PCR\} analysis showed hypoacetylation of \{H3\} or \{H4\} histone associated with the proximal promoter of downregulated calcineurin B, IP3-R1, myosin Va or \{PLC\} β4 gene in the cerebellum of \{SCA3\} mouse. \{HDAC\} inhibitor sodium butyrate reversed ataxin-3-Q79-induced hypoacetylation of histone \{H3\} or \{H4\} associated with the proximal promoter of calcineurin B, IP3-R1, myosin Va or \{PLC\} β4 gene. Sodium butyrate also prevented ataxin-3-Q79-induced impairment of \{LTD\} induction in Purkinje neurons of \{SCA3\} mice. Our results suggest that polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3-Q79 impairs \{HAT\} activity, leading to histone hypoacetylation, downregulated expression of cerebellar genes required for \{LTD\} induction and impaired induction of cerebellar \{LTD\} in the \{SCA3\} transgenic mouse.

The dynamic effect of an autapse is detected by imposing a feedback term with a specific time-delay and autaptic intensity. We found that the delayed autaptic feedback connection switches the electrical activities of the \{HR\} neuron among quiescent, periodic and chaotic firing patterns. In the case of an electrical autapse, the transition from a periodic to a chaotic state occurs depending on the specific autaptic intensity and the time-delay. The excitatory chemical autapse plays a positive role in generating and enhancing the chaotic state. A time delay could decrease and suppress the chaotic state in the case of inhibitory chemical self-connections with a proper autaptic intensity. The bifurcation diagram vs. time-delay and autaptic intensity has been extensively studied, and the time series of membrane potentials and the distribution of information entropy have also been calculated to confirm the bifurcation analysis.

Recent evidence suggests a link between mitochondrial dysfunction in fast spiking cortical interneurons and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction restricted to parvalbumin interneurons has not been directly addressed in vivo. To investigate the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in parvalbumin interneurons in vivo, we generated conditional knockout mice with a progressive decline in oxidative phosphorylation by deleting cox10 gene selectively in parvalbumin neurons (PV-Cox10 CKO). Cox10 ablation results in defective assembly of cytochrome oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the electron transfer chain, and leads to mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction. PV-Cox10 \{CKO\} mice showed a progressive loss of cytochrome oxidase in cortical parvalbumin interneurons. Cytochrome oxidase protein levels were significantly reduced starting at postnatal day 60, and this was not associated with a change in parvalbumin interneuron density. Analyses of intrinsic electrophysiological properties in layer 5 primary somatosensory cortex revealed that parvalbumin interneurons could not sustain their typical high frequency firing, and their overall excitability was enhanced. An increase in both excitatory and inhibitory input onto parvalbumin interneurons was observed in PV-Cox10 \{CKO\} mice, resulting in a disinhibited network with an imbalance of excitation/inhibition. Investigation of network oscillations in PV-Cox10 \{CKO\} mice, using local field potential recordings in anesthetized mice, revealed significantly increased gamma and theta frequency oscillation power in both medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. PV-Cox10 \{CKO\} mice did not exhibit muscle strength or gross motor activity deficits in the time frame of the experiments, but displayed impaired sensory gating and sociability. Taken together, these data reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction in parvalbumin interneurons can alter their intrinsic physiology and network connectivity, resulting in behavioral alterations similar to those observed in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism.

Here we investigated the effect of bradykinin on the electrical activity of rat myenteric neurons, the key players for regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Bradykinin (2×10−8 mol/l) induced a biphasic increase in frequency of action potentials measured with microelectrode arrays. This increase was mirrored by a biphasic increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which was observed in about 40% of the myenteric neurons. The bradykinin \{B1\} receptor agonist des-arg9-bradykinin as well as the bradykinin \{B2\} receptor agonist hyp3-bradykinin induced a similar effect on [Ca2+]i. Immunocytochemical stainings confirmed the expression of both receptor types by myenteric ganglionic cells. Real time \{PCR\} showed that the inducible \{B1\} receptor was upregulated during cell culture. The inhibition of cyclooxygenases with piroxicam reduced the effect of bradykinin on the electrical activity of myenteric neurons. The suppression of the glial growth on microelectrode arrays did not affect the bradykinin-induced change in frequency of action potentials. This suggests that prostaglandins, which probably mediate the effect of bradykinin, are not exclusively released from glial cells. The bradykinin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and was inhibited by Co2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+, blockers of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, indicating a stimulation of the influx of extracellular Ca2+ by the kinin. Consequently, bradykinin induces a Ca2+ influx in myenteric neurons via Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. "

It was also demonstrated that \{DHEA\} is able to attenuate the hypometabolism that is related to some neurodegenerative diseases, eliciting neuroprotective effects in different experimental models of neurodegeneration.

It was observed that after 12 hours of pre-treatment, \{DHEA\} was able to protect SH-SY5Y cells from glucose deprivation for 6 h (DHEA 10−12, 10−8 and 10−6M) and 8 h (DHEA 10−8 M). In contrast, \{DHEA\} was not neuroprotective against glucose deprivation for 12 or 24 h. \{DHEA\} (10−8M) also protected SH-SY5Y cells when added together or even 1 h after the beginning of glucose deprivation (6 h). Furthermore, \{DHEA\} (10−8M) also protected primary neurons from both sexes against glucose deprivation. In summary, our findings indicate that \{DHEA\} is neuroprotective against glucose deprivation in human neuroblastoma cells and in male and female mouse hippocampal neurons.

In the liver, some xenobiotics can be metabolized by \{CYPs\} into more reactive products that can damage hepatocytes and induce cell death. In addition, normal \{CYP\} activity may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that contribute to cell damage through oxidative mechanisms. \{CYP2E1\} is a \{CYP\} isoform that can generate \{ROS\} leading to cytotoxicity in multiple tissue types. The aim of this study was to determine whether \{CYP2E1\} induction may lead to significant brain cell impairment. Immunological analysis revealed that exposure of primary cerebellar granule neuronal cultures to the \{CYP\} inducer isoniazid, increased \{CYP2E1\} expression. In the presence of buthionine sulfoximine, an agent that reduces glutathione levels, isoniazid treatment also resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, \{DNA\} oxidation and cell death. These effects were attenuated by simultaneous exposure to diallyl sulfide, a \{CYP2E1\} inhibitor, or to a mimetic of superoxide dismutase/catalase, (Euka). These results suggest that in cases of reduced antioxidant levels, the induction of brain \{CYP2E1\} could represent a risk of in situ neuronal damage. "

Focal \{RC\} defects are also associated with ageing and neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. in substantia nigra (SN) neurons from Parkinson's disease patients. In mitochondrial disease and ageing, mtDNA mutational loads vary considerably between neurons necessitating single cell-based assessment of \{RC\} deficiencies. Evaluating the full extent of \{RC\} deficiency within \{SN\} neurons is challenging because their size precludes investigations in serial sections. We developed an assay to measure \{RC\} abnormalities in individual \{SN\} neurons using quadruple immunofluorescence. New method Using antibodies against subunits of complex I (CI) and IV, porin and tyrosine hydroxylase together with IgG subtype-specific fluorescent labelled secondary antibodies, we quantified the expression of \{CI\} and \{CIV\} compared to mitochondrial mass in dopaminergic neurons. CI:porin and CIV:porin ratios were determined relative to a standard control. Results Quantification of expression of complex subunits in midbrain sections from patients with mtDNA disease and known \{RC\} deficiencies consistently showed reduced CI:porin and/or CIV:porin ratios. Comparison with existing method(s) The standard histochemical method to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction, the cytochrome c oxidase/succinate dehydrogenase assay, measures \{CIV\} and \{CII\} activities. To also study \{CI\} in a patient, immunohistology in additional sections, i.e. in different neurons, is required. Our method allows correlation of the expression of CI, \{CIV\} and mitochondrial mass at a single cell level. Conclusion Quantitative quadruple-label immunofluorescence is a reliable tool to measure \{RC\} deficiencies in individual neurons that will enable new insights in the molecular mechanisms underlying inherited and acquired mitochondrial dysfunction.

However, despite clear evidence of uptake into tissues and a range of toxic effects in cells and animals, an animal model in which \{BMAA\} induces a neurodegenerative picture resembling \{ALS\} is lacking, possibly in part reflecting limited understanding of critical factors pertaining to its absorption, biodistribution and metabolism. To bypass some of these issues and ensure delivery to a key site of disease pathology, we examined effects of prolonged (30 day) intrathecal infusion in wild type (WT) rats, and rats harboring the familial \{ALS\} associated \{G93A\} \{SOD1\} mutation, over an age range (80 ± 2 to 110 ± 2 days) during which the \{G93A\} rats are developing disease pathology yet remain asymptomatic. The \{BMAA\} exposures induced changes that in many ways resemble those seen in the \{G93A\} rats, with degenerative changes in ventral horn motor neurons (MNs) with relatively little dorsal horn pathology, marked ventral horn astrogliosis and increased 3-nitrotyrosine labeling in and surrounding MNs, a loss of labeling for the astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT-1, surrounding MNs, and mild accumulation and aggregation of TDP-43 in the cytosol of some injured and degenerating MNs. Thus, prolonged intrathecal infusion of \{BMAA\} can reproduce a picture in spinal cord incorporating many of the pathological hallmarks of diverse forms of human ALS, including substantial restriction of overt pathological changes to the ventral horn, consistent with the possibility that environmental \{BMAA\} exposure could be a risk factor and/or contributor to some human disease.

Among all, the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer are the two important parameters to be decided and normally no rules are available for finding them precisely. In this paper a method to find the hidden layer size is described beside the main purpose of the paper which is to compare the performance of the first break picker networks. We used a known learning-curve and introduce a measure named “neuron-curve” to find the optimal layer size &amp; minimum size of training set. This paper shows the application of these two curves in finding the first break picks of seismic refraction data. Furthermore, the effect of noise on the architecture of two known neural networks (multilayer perceptron and radial basis function) in the first break picking is also investigated. "

It induces neurotoxic effects in several areas of the brain via enhancing dopamine (DA) level abnormally, which may cause a secondary release of glutamate (GLU). However, repeated administration of \{METH\} still increases release of \{GLU\} even when dopamine content in tissue is significantly depleted. It implies that some other mechanisms are likely to involve in METH-induced \{GLU\} release. The goal of this study was to observe \{METH\} affected glutamatergic synaptic transmission in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons and to explore the mechanism of \{METH\} modulated \{GLU\} release. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we found that \{METH\} (0.1–50.0 μM) increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). However, \{METH\} decreased the frequency of sEPSCs and mEPSCs at high concentration of 100 μM. The postsynaptic \{NMDA\} receptor currents and P/Q-type calcium channel were not affected by the use of \{METH\} (10,100 μM). \{METH\} did not present visible effect on N-type Ca2+ channel current at the concentration lower than 50.0 μM, but it was inhibited by use of \{METH\} at a 100 μM. The effect of \{METH\} on glutamatergic synaptic transmission was not revered by pretreated with \{DA\} receptor antagonist SCH23390. These results suggest that \{METH\} directly modulated presynaptic \{GLU\} release at a different concentration, while dopaminergic system was not involved in \{METH\} modulated release of \{GLU\} in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons.

The present study was conducted to investigate the influence of IL-18 on rat primary cortical neurons and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We proved that rrIL-18 increased the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with rrIL-18 (50 ng/ml) deactivated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) by facilitating its phosphorylation, enhanced the expression of Phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and p-Akt, standing for the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. As its pivotal downstream pathways, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)/Bcl-2 and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) were examined in further steps. Our data revealed that rrIL-18 stimulated NF-κB activation, improved p-CREB and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression levels. But rrIL-18 had little or no effect on GSK-3β pathway. Besides, rrIL-18 increased levels of \{BDNF\} and Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreased cleaved caspase-3 expression to protect cortical neurons from damage induced by oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). These results in vitro showed the protection of IL-18 on cortical neurons. And this direct neuroprotective effect of IL-18 is crippled by \{PI3K\} inhibitor wortmannin. "

The brain nuclei controlling song learning and production in males are considerably larger than in females. The robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) is a premotor nucleus, playing a key role in controlling singing. \{RA\} receives denser synapse inputs in males than in females. Sex differences of excitatory synaptic transmission in the \{RA\} projection neurons (PNs) have not been reported. In the present study, using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording, spontaneous \{EPSCs\} (sEPSCs) and miniature \{EPSCs\} (mEPSCs) of \{RA\} \{PNs\} in the intact males and females were recorded. The average frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs/mEPSCs in the intact males were higher than females. The half-width and decay time of sEPSCs/mEPSCs in the intact males were longer than females. In order to verify whether these sex differences related to sex steroids, males were castrated. The average frequency of sEPSCs/mEPSCs in castrated males was lower than intact males and was similar to in females; the amplitude was not changed after castrating. These results demonstrate the sexually dimorphic of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the \{RA\} PNs, the \{RA\} \{PNs\} in males receive more excitatory synaptic transmission and these sex differences were partly affected by sex hormones. These findings contribute to further illuminate the neural mechanisms under the sexually dimorphism in song production of adult zebra finches. "

Despite the importance of the spatial component in the characterisation of neural circuits, it has not received the attention it deserves. While multi-electrodes are widely used in the study of microcircuits, the spatial information available from them remains largely unexploited for analysis beyond spike sorting. Here we show how the spatial pattern of the extracellular signal is determined by both the electrophysiology and morphology of neurons. Starting from known current source models for the generation of the extracellular potential, we use the spatial pattern observed across a multi-electrode array to localise and classify neurons into putative morphological classes. We evaluated the localisation and classification models with low fitting errors in simulated data. When applying them to recorded data we found correspondence between localisation statistics and expected recording radius and found evidence to support the separation into putative morphological classes. While existing localisation methods do not hold for the recording distances expected on multi-electrode recordings (under 60 μm), classification methods have been limited to the temporal component by either characterising spike shape or firing patterns. We show here how the information available from extracellular recordings can be used to localise and classify neurons based on the spatial pattern seen by multi-electrode arrays. Together they can improve current characterisation and classification of neurons based on complementary criteria such us firing pattern and functional characterisation. "

Confocal imaging analysis revealed vincristine-induced microtubule depolymerization. By using \{AFM\} for high-resolution live cell imaging and quantitative analysis, we observed significant changes in cell surface roughness and stiffness of vincristine-treated neurons. Elastic modulus was decreased (21-45%) with increasing dosage of vincristine. Further study with paclitaxel, another well-known \{CIPN\} drug, confirmed the link between cell mechanics and cytoskeleton organization. These data support that our system can be used for probing potential \{CIPN\} drugs that are of enormous benefit to new chemotherapy drug development.

The \{HCR\} model has been successfully applied to solve six application problems, and the results are used to compare with the existing low complexity simple circle reservoir (SCR) ESN. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the new model under different ratios of wavelet-neurons, different circle distributions and different input sign patterns. Simulation results show that the \{HCR\} model achieves significantly better performance in prediction accuracy than the \{SCR\} model. Additionally, the \{HCR\} model has similar low complexity as the SCR. Moreover, the short-term memory capacity (MC) in the \{HCR\} is close to the theoretical optimal \{MC\} value. "

Absence of the technology needed to represent all the senses and the mathematical difficulty of making geometric representations of functions of a complex and of more general division algebra variables make it difficult to validate the mathematical outcome of this approach to neural firings.

The preservation of a viable population of \{SGNs\} in deafness can be achieved in animal models with exogenous application of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3. For translation into clinical application, a suitable delivery strategy that provides ongoing neurotrophic support and promotes long-term \{SGN\} survival is required. Cell-based neurotrophin treatment has the potential to meet the specific requirements for clinical application, and we have previously reported that Schwann cells genetically modified to express \{BDNF\} can support \{SGN\} survival in deafness for 4 weeks. This study aimed to investigate various parameters important for the development of a long-term cell-based neurotrophin treatment to support \{SGN\} survival. Specifically, we investigated different (i) cell types, (ii) gene transfer methods and (iii) neurotrophins, in order to determine which variables may provide long-term neurotrophin expression and which, therefore, may be the most effective for supporting long-term \{SGN\} survival in vivo. We found that fibroblasts that were nucleofected to express \{BDNF\} provided the most sustained neurotrophin expression, with ongoing \{BDNF\} expression for at least 30 weeks. In addition, the secreted neurotrophin was biologically active and elicited survival effects on \{SGNs\} in vitro. Nucleofected fibroblasts may therefore represent a method for safe, long-term delivery of neurotrophins to the deafened cochlea to support \{SGN\} survival in deafness. "

Neuropeptide release from sensory neurons depends on an increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentration. In this study we investigated the role of two types of pH sensors in acid-induced Ca2 + entry and neuropeptide release from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel (TRPV1) and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are both H+-activated ion channels present in these neurons, and are therefore potential pH sensors for this process. We demonstrate with in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry that \{TRPV1\} and several \{ASIC\} subunits are co-expressed with neuropeptides in \{DRG\} neurons. The activation of \{ASICs\} and of \{TRPV1\} led to an increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentration. While \{TRPV1\} has a high Ca2 + permeability and allows direct Ca2 + entry when activated, we show here that \{ASICs\} of \{DRG\} neurons mediate Ca2 + entry mostly by depolarization-induced activation of voltage-gated Ca2 + channels and only to a small extent via the pore of Ca2 +-permeable ASICs. Extracellular acidification led to the release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide from \{DRG\} neurons. The pH dependence and the pharmacological profile indicated that TRPV1, but not ASICs, induced neuropeptide secretion. In conclusion, this study shows that although both \{TRPV1\} and \{ASICs\} mediate Ca2 + influx, \{TRPV1\} is the principal sensor for acid-induced neuropeptide secretion from sensory neurons. "

In the present study, we propose a novel ‘synapse compartmentalization’ culture system, in which synapses are concentrated at controlled locations. We fabricated a negative dot array pattern by coating the entire surface with poly-l-lysine (PLL) and subsequent microcontact printing of 1) substrates which mask positive charge of \{PLL\} (Fc, \{BSA\} and laminin), or 2) a chemorepulsive protein (Semaphorin 3F-Fc).

Therefore, this quantifiable and controllable dot array pattern by microcontact printing will be potential useful for bio-chip platforms for the high-density assays used in synapse-related neurobiological studies.

Hence, the selection of stimulation parameters is full of challenges. Additionally, due to the complexity of neural system, together with omnipresent noises, the accurate model of thalamic relay neuron is unknown. Thus, the iterative learning control of the thalamic relay neuron’s Parkinsonian state based on various variables is presented. Combining the iterative learning control with typical proportional–integral control algorithm, a novel and efficient control strategy is proposed, which does not require any particular knowledge on the detailed physiological characteristics of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop and can automatically adjust the stimulation parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy to restore the fidelity of thalamic relay in the Parkinsonian condition. Furthermore, through changing the important parameter—the maximum ionic conductance densities of low-threshold calcium current, the dominant characteristic of the proposed method which is independent of the accurate model can be further verified.

However, the poor differentiation and maturation of \{DA\} neurons and decreased cell survival after transplantation are a challenge. We have previously demonstrated that Brn4, a member of the \{POU\} domain family of transcription factors, induced the differentiation of \{NSCs\} into neurons and promoted their maturation. In this study, we directly transduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, into \{NSCs\} to induce \{DA\} neuronal differentiation. However, these \{DA\} neurons were morphologically immature and seldom expressed dopamine transporter (DAT), a late marker of mature \{DA\} neurons. In contrast, \{TH\} co-transfected with Brn4 generated increased number of mature \{DA\} neurons. Furthermore, Brn4 significantly induced the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) with its receptors GFRα-1 and Ret, which may contribute to the maturation and survival of differentiated \{DA\} neurons. Our findings may be of future importance for the use of \{NSCs\} in cell replacement therapy of PD. "

abstract = "Abstract Programmed cell death plays a critical role during cerebellar development. In particular, it has been shown in vivo and in vitro that developing cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) die apoptotically. Apoptosis involves a series of morphological changes and the activation of caspases. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) is implicated in negative regulation of caspase activation and apoptotic cell death. Although apoptotic death of \{CGN\} has been extensively studied, there is no information about the role of \{IAPs\} in the developing cerebellum. Here, we studied the participation of some members of \{IAPs\} in the survival of the developing rat \{CGN\} in culture and under physiological conditions. Under these conditions, we found a differential expression pattern of cIAP-1, cIAP-2, \{XIAP\} and survivin during cerebellar development in an age-dependent manner, highlighting the significant increase of \{XIAP\} levels. We also detected an interaction between \{XIAP\} and caspase 3 at postnatal day (P) 12 and 16. On the other hand, we found a significant decrease of \{XIAP\} levels in cultured \{CGN\} maintained in chronic potassium deprivation, an apoptotic condition, suggesting a possible relationship between \{XIAP\} levels and neuronal viability. Under these conditions, we also detected the interaction of \{XIAP\} with active caspase-3. The down-regulation of \{XIAP\} in \{CGN\} cultured under survival conditions (chronic potassium depolarization) induced a reduction of cell viability and an increment of apoptotic cells. These findings support the idea that \{IAPs\} could be involved in the survival of \{CGN\} and that \{XIAP\} might be critical for neuronal survival in cerebellar development and during chronic depolarization in cultured \{CGN\} through a mechanism involving caspase inhibition.

The odourants l-alanine and taurocholic acid (TCA) specifically activate microvillous or ciliated OSNs, respectively, in fish. We recorded electro-olfactograms (EOG) in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas; a laboratory-reared model species) and wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens) whose olfactory chambers were perfused with either l-alanine or \{TCA\} to determine if \{OSN\} classes were differentially vulnerable to contaminants, in this case copper or nickel. Results were consistent in both species and demonstrated that nickel targeted and impaired microvillous \{OSN\} function, while copper targeted and impaired ciliated \{OSN\} function. This result suggests that contaminant-specific effects observed in model laboratory species extrapolate to wild fish populations. Moreover, fathead minnows exposed to copper failed to perceive a conspecific alarm cue in a choice maze, whereas those exposed to nickel could respond to the same conspecific cue. These results demonstrate that fathead minnows perceive conspecific, damage-released alarm cue by ciliated, but not microvillous, OSNs. Fish living in copper-contaminated environments may be more vulnerable to predation than those in clean lakes owing to targeted effects on ciliated OSNs. "

We hypothesized that the pattern of \{NSE\} level changes in the peripheral blood during the acute period of ischemic stroke is dependent on stroke mechanism and is associated with hemorrhagic transformation. Methods Acute ischemic stroke patients visiting our center within 24 hours of symptom onset were recruited into the study. \{NSE\} levels were obtained serially at various time points after stroke, and the pattern of change was categorized into no significant change, continuously increasing, continuously decreasing, with 1 peak and with 2 peaks. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables were compared among the patient groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to verify the independent association between the second \{NSE\} peak and hemorrhagic transformation after adjusting for potential confounders. Results Among 83 patients, \{NSE\} levels were stationary in 22 (26.5%) of the patients, increased in 9 (10.8%), decreased in 18 (21.7%), and showed 1 peak in 17 (20.5%) and 2 peaks in 17 (20.5%) patients. The incidence of atrial fibrillation and hemorrhagic transformation was significantly elevated (P = .02) in patients with 2 \{NSE\} peaks. Furthermore, the second \{NSE\} peak and the initial lesion volume were associated independently with hemorrhagic transformation after we adjusted for potential confounders (odds ratio = 6.844 and 1.024, P = .04 and .02, respectively). Conclusions Serial \{NSE\} analysis during the acute period of ischemic stroke is useful for monitoring hemorrhagic transformation and the blood-brain barrier disruption status. "

Although apoptosis has been well recognized to be closely associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and function, it is still unclear whether the neuroprotective effect of 14,15-EET is mediated by promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in cortical neurons under the condition of oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). In this study, we found that 14,15-EET improved cell viability and inhibited apoptosis of cortical neurons. 14,15-EET significantly increased the mitochondrial mass and the ratio of mitochondrial \{DNA\} to nuclear DNA. Key makers of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma-coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), were elevated at both mRNA and protein levels in the cortical neurons treated with 14,15-EET. Moreover, 14,15-EET markedly attenuated the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced ROS, while increased \{ATP\} synthesis. Knockdown of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) by siRNA blunted the up-regulation of PGC-1α and NRF-1 stimulated by 14,15-EET, and consequently abolished the neuroprotective effect of 14,15-EET. Our results indicate that 14,15-EET protects neurons from OGD-induced apoptosis by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and function through \{CREB\} mediated activation of PGC-1α and NRF-1. "

PrPC is a ubiquitous cell surface protein, abundantly expressed in neurons, which constitute the targets of PrPSc-mediated toxicity. Converging evidence have highlighted that neuronal, GPI-anchored PrPC is absolutely required for prion-induced neuropathogenesis, which warrants investigating into the normal function exerted by PrPC in a neuronal context. It is now well-established that PrPC can serve as a cell signalling molecule, able to mobilize transduction cascades in response to interactions with partners. This function endows PrPC with the capacity to participate in multiple neuronal processes, ranging from survival to synaptic plasticity. A diverse array of data have allowed to shed light on how this function is corrupted by PrPSc. Recently, amyloid Aβ oligomers, whose accumulation is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), were shown to similarly instigate toxic events by deviating PrPC-mediated signalling. Here, we provide an overview of the various signal transduction cascades ascribed to PrPC in neurons, summarize how their subversion by PrPSc or Aβ oligomers contributes to \{TSE\} or \{AD\} neuropathogenesis and discuss the ensuing clinical implications.

Damaraland mole-rats are eusocial, they live in colonies that are characterized by a reproductive division of labor and a subdivision into castes based on physiology and behavior. Damaraland mole-rats are exceptionally long lived and reproductive animals show delayed aging compared to non-reproductive animals. In the present study, we described the hippocampal architecture and the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis of wild-derived, adult Damaraland mole-rats in relation to sex, relative age and social status or caste. Overall, Damaraland mole-rats were found to have a small hippocampus and low rates of neurogenesis. We found no correlation between neurogenesis and sex or relative age. Social status or caste was the most prominent modulator of neurogenesis. An inverse relationship between neurogenesis and social status was apparent, with queens displaying the lowest neurogenesis while the worker mole-rats had the most. As there is no natural progression from one caste to another, social status within a colony was relatively stable and is reflected in the level of neurogenesis. Our results correspond to those found in the naked mole-rat, and may reflect an evolutionary and environmentally conserved trait within social mole-rat species. "

Alterations of this equilibrium have been associated with spinal motor neuron hyperexcitability and degeneration, which can be induced by excitotoxicity or by decreasing inhibitory neurotransmission. Here we review the ventral horn neuronal network and the possible involvement of inhibitory circuits in the mechanisms of degeneration of motor neurons characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Whereas glutamate mediated excitotoxicity seems to be an important factor, recent experimental and histopathological evidence argue in favor of a decreased activity of the inhibitory circuits controlling motor neuron excitability, mainly the recurrent inhibition exerted by Renshaw cells. A decreased Renshaw cell activity may be caused by cell loss or by a reduction of its inhibitory action secondary to a decreased excitation from cholinergic interneurons. Ultimately, inhibitory failure by either mechanism might lead to motor neuron degeneration, and this suggests inhibitory circuits and Renshaw cells as pharmacologic targets for \{ALS\} treatment. "

Brain slices of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nBM) were cultured with or without \{NGF\} (10 ng/ml) or platelet extracts (100 μg/ml) or fresh platelets (108 platelets/ml). In order to enhance \{NGF\} in platelets recombinant \{NGF\} (100 ng) was loaded into platelets using ultrasound (3 h). Our data show that recombinant \{NGF\} markedly supports survival of cholinergic neurons. The addition of fresh platelets showed a tendency for enhancing cholinergic neuron numbers, while platelet extracts had no effects. Ultrasound was highly effective to load recombinant \{NGF\} into platelets. The addition of NGF-loaded platelets markedly enhanced cholinergic neuron numbers. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that NGF-derived platelets may counteract cell death of cholinergic neurons. "

In layer V, 0.5 µM of \{TRH\} induced a small increase in spike half-width, while 1 and 5 µM induced a strong but transient change in spike half-width, and amplitude; after hyperpolarization amplitude was modified at 5 µM of TRH.

We hypothesized that this phenomenon might be explained by characterizing the sensory neurons targeted by BoNT/A in the central nervous system after its axonal transport. BoNT/A’s central antinociceptive activity following its application into the rat whisker pad was examined in trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and higher-level nociceptive brain areas using BoNT/A-cleaved synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) and c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Occurrence of cleaved SNAP-25 in \{TNC\} was examined after nonselective ganglion ablation with formalin or selective denervation of capsaicin-sensitive (vanilloid receptor-1 or TRPV1-expressing) neurons, and in relation to different cellular and neuronal markers. Regional c-Fos activation and effect of TRPV1-expressing afferent denervation on toxin’s antinociceptive action were studied in formalin-induced orofacial pain. BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP-25 was observed in TNC, but not in higher-level nociceptive nuclei. Cleaved SNAP-25 in \{TNC\} disappeared after formalin-induced trigeminal ganglion ablation or capsaicin-induced sensory denervation. Occurrence of cleaved SNAP-25 in \{TNC\} and BoNT/A antinociceptive activity in formalin-induced orofacial pain were prevented by denervation with capsaicin. Cleaved SNAP-25 localization demonstrated toxin’s presynaptic activity in TRPV1-expressing neurons. BoNT/A reduced the c-Fos activation in TNC, locus coeruleus, and periaqueductal gray. Present experiments suggest that BoNT/A alters the nociceptive transmission at the central synapse of primary afferents. Targeting of TRPV1-expressing neurons might be associated with observed selectivity of BoNT/A action only in certain types of pain. "

Male Sprague–Dawley rats were given saline or 3 mg/kg \{AMPH\} (i.p.) repeatedly during adolescence or adulthood and following a withdrawal period of up to 5 weeks (Experiment 1) or up to 14 weeks (Experiment 2), they were sacrificed for in vitro whole-cell recordings in layer V/VI of the medial PFC. We found that in brain slices from either adolescent- or adult-exposed rats, there was an attenuation of dopamine-induced increases in inhibitory synaptic currents in pyramidal cells. These effects did not depend on age of exposure, were mediated at least partially by a reduced sensitivity of \{D1\} receptors in AMPH-treated rats, and were associated with an enhanced behavioral response to the drug in a separate group of rats given an \{AMPH\} challenge following the longest withdrawal period. Together, these data reveal a prolonged effect of \{AMPH\} exposure on medial \{PFC\} function that persisted for up to 14 weeks in adolescent-exposed animals.

abstract = "Abstract The presence of nitrergic cells in the prefrontal cortex has been confirmed, however little is known about the postnatal development of these cells. Nitrergic neurons were studied histochemically by using NADPH-diaphorase staining in the prefrontal cortex of male Wistar rats from postnatal day 7–21 (P7–21). Neuronal NADPH-diaphorase is a nitric oxide synthase that provides a specific histochemical marker for neurons producing nitric oxide (NO). \{NO\} acts as a neurotransmitter and intracellular signaling molecule in the nervous system. We observed in 7 day old rats NADPH-d containing neurons that were intensely stained. These neurons were bipolar with a short dendrite with average length of 23 μm. During the second postnatal week, the neurons were mainly bipolar and were rarely multipolar. By \{P14\} the cells were located primarily in cortical layers III–VI. Nitrergic neurons of the 21 day old rats were histochemically identified as multipolar cells with long radial extending dendrites. Dendrites of neurons in 14 and 21 day old rats were a similar length with an average of 57 μm. These results suggest that nitrergic neurons differentiate during a relatively short period of time and reach their structural maturity by the end of the second week of postnatal development. "

Recently somatostatin was shown to exert analgesic effects via activation of the sst4 receptor. Although the analgesia in pain models is established, the precise molecular mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. This research aimed to identify possible anti-nociceptive mechanisms, showing functional links of the sst4 receptor to G-protein coupled inward rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels and reduction of voltage stimulated calcium influx within the pain processing pathway. Whole cell voltage clamp experiments and calcium imaging experiments were conducted on \{DRG\} neurons prepared from adult rats. Application of an sst4 receptor selective agonist, J-2156, on \{DRG\} neurons induced a \{GIRK\} modulated potassium current, and inhibited voltage sensitive calcium current. Both mechanisms are thought to contribute to the analgesic properties of sst4 receptor agonists. "

Specimens of antrum and ileum from eight control-dogs and five insulin-dependent DM-dogs were collected. \{MP\} neurons were immunohistochemically identified with the anti-HuC/HuD antibody, while nitrergic neurons were identified with the antibody anti-neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The density of HuC/HuD-immunoreactive (IR) neurons was determined and the nitrergic neurons were quantified as a relative percentage, in consideration of the total number of HuC/HuD-IR neurons. Furthermore, the density of nitrergic fibers in the muscular layers was calculated. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Compared to control-dogs, no significant differences resulted in the density of HuC/HuD –IR neurons in the antrum and ileum of DM-dogs; however, HuC/HuD-immunolabeling showed nuclear internalization and fragmentation in DM-dogs. In the stomachs of control- and DM-dogs, the percentages of nitrergic neurons were 30 ± 6% and 25 ± 2%, respectively (P = 0.112). In the ileum of the control-dogs, the percentage of nitrergic neurons was 29 ± 5%, while in the DM-dogs, it was significantly reduced 19 ± 5% (P = 0.006). The density of nNOS-IR nervous fibers was meaningful reduced in either the tracts considered. Notably, the ganglia of DM-dogs showed also a thickening of the periganglionic connective tissue. These findings indicate that \{DM\} in dogs induce modification of the myenteric neurons and, in particular, of the nitrergic neuronal subpopulation. "

Additionally, the \{LHy\} and \{PVNc\} showed increased \{FOS\} immunoreactive (-ir) cells in the birds chronically stressed when compared to controls. In contrast, the \{NHpC\} showed decreased FOS-ir cells following the 10 day chronic stress imposed. Thereafter, restraint stress experiments were performed to identify activated arginine vasotocin (AVT) neurons (parvocellular or magnocellular) using immunocytochemistry. Of the six \{FOS\} activated structures, the \{PVN\} was known to contain distinct size groups of AVT-ir neurons, parvocellular (small), medium sized and magnocellular (large). Using dual immunostaining (AVT/FOS), AVT-ir parvocellular neurons in the \{PVNc\} were found activated in both acute and chronic stress. To determine whether these AVT-ir parvocellular neurons are co-localized with corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), an attempt was made to visualize CRH-ir neurons using colchicine. Although AVT-ir and CRH-ir parvocellular neurons occur in the PVNc, only a few neurons were shown co-localized with \{AVT\} and \{CRH\} after acute restraint stress.

SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical neurons were treated with various doses of \{DADLE\} for 24–72 h. Results demonstrated that DADLE, at all doses and time points examined, significantly inhibited cellular transcription in both cells without causing cell injury. Following recovery for 72 h without \{DADLE\} in primary neurons, the transcriptional activity fully resumed. Delta opioid receptor (DOR) is not involved in this process, as Naltrindole could not abolish DADLE׳s transcriptional inhibitory effects. Further studies in primary cortical neurons show that \{DADLE\} significantly inhibited phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of \{RNA\} polymerase II. These data indicate that \{DADLE\} is able to decrease cellular transcription through inhibiting phosphorylation of \{RNA\} polymerase \{II\} in neurons, which may provide mechanistic insight into its reported neuroprotective effects, and suggests that it warrants further exploration as a potential therapeutic strategy for neuroprotection.

Here, we report that αSN decreased the level of synaptophysin, a protein used as an indicator of synaptic density, in cultured hippocampal and hiPSC-derived neurons. However, simultaneous treatment with αSN and \{TQ\} protected neurons against αSN-induced synapse damage, as revealed by immunostaining. Moreover, administration of \{TQ\} efficiently induced protection in these cells against αSN-induced inhibition of synaptic vesicle recycling in hippocampal and hiPSC-derived neurons as well as against mutated \{P123H\} β-synuclein (βSN) in hippocampal neurons, as revealed by experiments using the fluorescent dye FM1-43. Using a multielectrode array, we further demonstrated that the treatment of hiPSC-derived neurons with αSN induced a reduction in spontaneous firing activity, and cotreatment with αSN and \{TQ\} partially reversed this loss. These results suggest that \{TQ\} protects cultured rat primary hippocampal and hiPSC-derived neurons against αSN-induced synaptic toxicity and could be a promising therapeutic agent for patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

Learning especially can induce structural remodeling of dendritic spines, which is thought to relate to memory formation. Classical Pavlovian fear conditioning (FC) traditionally pairs an auditory cue with an aversive footshock, and has been widely used to study neural processes underlying associative learning and memory. Past research has found dendritic spine changes after \{FC\} in several structures. But, due to heterogeneity of cells within brain structures and limitations of traditional neuroanatomical techniques, it is unclear if all cells included in analyses were actually active during learning processes, even if known circuits are isolated. In this study, we employed a novel approach to analyze structural plasticity explicitly in neurons activated by exposure to either cued or uncued footshocks. We used male and female Arc-dVenus transgenic mice, which express the Venus fluorophore driven by the activity-related Arc promoter, to identify neurons that were active during either scenario. We then targeted fluorescent microinjections to Arc+ and neighboring Arc− neurons in the basolateral area of the amygdala (BLA) and auditory association cortex (TeA). In both \{BLA\} and TeA, Arc+ neurons had reduced thin and mushroom spine densities compared to Arc− neurons. This effect was present in males and females alike and also in both cued and uncued shock groups. Overall, this study adds to our understanding of how neuronal activity affects structural plasticity, and represents a methodological advance in the ways we can directly relate structural changes to experience-related neural activity.

Mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is mainly mediated by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), but recent reports also indicate that mitochondrial Ca2+-influx mechanisms are regulated not only by MCU, but also by multiple channels/transporters. We previously reported that ryanodine receptor (RyR), which is a one of the main Ca2+-release channels at endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) in excitable cells, is expressed at the mitochondrial inner membrane (IMM) and serves as a part of the Ca2+ uptake mechanism in cardiomyocytes. Although RyR is also expressed in neuronal cells and works as a Ca2+-release channel at ER, it has not been well investigated whether neuronal mitochondria possess RyR and, if so, whether this mitochondrial RyR has physiological functions in neuronal cells. Here we show that neuronal mitochondria express RyR at \{IMM\} and accumulate Ca2+ through this channel in response to cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, which is similar to what we observed in another excitable cell-type, cardiomyocytes. In addition, the RyR blockers dantrolene or ryanodine significantly inhibits mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in permeabilized striatal neurons. Taken together, we identify RyR as an additional mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake mechanism in response to the elevation of [Ca2+]c in neurons, suggesting that this channel may play a critical role in mitochondrial Ca2+-mediated functions such as energy metabolism.

Here, we show that ghrelin-induced activation of \{PVN\} \{CRF\} neurons involved inhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inputs, likely via ghrelin binding sites that were localized at \{GABAergic\} terminals within the PVN. While ghrelin activated \{PVN\} \{CRF\} neurons in the presence of neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor antagonists or in arcuate nucleus (ARC)-ablated mice, it failed to do it so in mice with ghrelin receptor expression limited to \{ARC\} agouti gene related protein (AgRP)/NPY neurons. These data support the notion that ghrelin activates \{PVN\} \{CRF\} neurons via inhibition of local \{GABAergic\} tone, in an ARC-independent manner.

Using rat primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons cultured in a microfluidic chamber, we investigated the effect of axonal application of high glucose and sildenafil on distal axonal growth. We found that axonal, but not cell body, application of high glucose locally inhibited distal axonal growth. However, axonal application of sildenafil overcame high glucose-reduced axonal growth. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis of distal axonal samples revealed that high glucose reduced axonal miR-146a levels and substantially increased miR-146a target genes, \{IRAK1\} and \{TRAF6\} in the axon.

Among these receptors, the endogenous expression of \{GPR3\} in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) is increased following development. \{GPR3\} is important for neurite outgrowth and neural maturation; however, the physiological functions of \{GPR3\} remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the survival and antiapoptotic functions of \{GPR3\} under normal and apoptosis-inducing culture conditions. Under normal culture conditions, \{CGNs\} from GPR3-knockout mice demonstrated lower survival than did \{CGNs\} from wild-type or GPR3-heterozygous mice. Cerebellar sections from \{GPR3\} −/− mice at P7, P14, and \{P21\} revealed more caspase-3-positive neurons in the internal granular layer than in cerebellar sections from wild-type mice. Conversely, in a potassium-deprivation model of apoptosis, increased expression of these three receptors promoted neuronal survival. The antiapoptotic effect of \{GPR3\} was also observed under hypoxic (1% O2/5% CO2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptotic conditions. We further investigated the signaling pathways involved in the GPR3-mediated antiapoptotic effect. The addition of the \{PKA\} inhibitor KT5720, the \{MAP\} kinase inhibitor U0126, and the \{PI3\} kinase inhibitor \{LY294002\} abrogated the GPR3-mediated antiapoptotic effect in a potassium-deprivation model of apoptosis, whereas the \{PKC\} inhibitor Gö6976 did not affect the antiapoptotic function of GPR3. Furthermore, downregulation of endogenous \{GPR3\} expression in \{CGNs\} resulted in a marked reduction in the basal levels of \{ERK\} and Akt phosphorylation under normal culture conditions. Finally, we used a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model in wild-type and GPR3-knockout mice to determine whether \{GPR3\} expression modulates neuronal survival after brain ischemia. After tMCAO, GPR3-knockout mice exhibited a significantly larger infarct area than did wild-type mice. Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the developmental expression of constitutively active Gs-coupled \{GPR3\} activates the \{ERK\} and Akt signaling pathways at the basal level, thereby protecting neurons from apoptosis that is induced by various stimuli.

In this work, we show that the calcium transport systems of the plasma membrane extruding calcium from the cytosol, plasma membrane calcium pumps (PMCA) and sodium–calcium exchangers (NCX), are also associated with these nanodomains. All these proteins were found to co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin-1 after treatment with 25 mM methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a lipid rafts solubilizing agent. However, the treatment of \{CGN\} with methyl-β-cyclodextrin largely attenuated the rise of cytosolic calcium induced by l-glutamate through NMDAr. Fluorescence energy transfer imaging revealed that all of them are present in sub-microdomains of a size smaller than 200 nm, with a peripheral distribution of the calcium extrusion systems \{PMCA\} and NCX. Fluorescence microscopy images analysis revealed high calcium dynamic sub-microcompartments near the plasma membrane in fura-2-loaded \{CGN\} at short times after addition of l-glutamate. In addition, the close proximity between sources of nitric oxide (nNOS) and superoxide anion (Cb5R) suggests that these nanodomains are involved in the fast and efficient cross-talk between calcium and redox signaling in neurons.

Pioneering clinical trials using transplants of fetal \{DA\} neuroblasts have given promising results, although a number of patients have developed graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs), and the mechanism underlying this troublesome side effect is still unknown. Here we have used a new model where the activity of the transplanted \{DA\} neurons can be selectively modulated using a bimodal chemogenetic (DREADD) approach, allowing either enhancement or reduction of the therapeutic effect. We show that exclusive activation of a cAMP-linked (Gs-coupled) \{DREADD\} or serotonin 5-HT6 receptor, located on the grafted \{DA\} neurons, is sufficient to induce GIDs. These findings establish a mechanistic link between the 5-HT6 receptor, intracellular cAMP, and \{GIDs\} in transplanted \{PD\} patients. This effect is thought to be mediated through counteraction of the \{D2\} autoreceptor feedback inhibition, resulting in a dysplastic \{DA\} release from the transplant. "

Application of 6-OHDA (0.5–2 mM) evoked a dose-dependent, desensitizing inward current and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) rise.

By calcium imaging of individual \{OSNs\} in intact mouse olfactory turbinates, we observed that a subset of \{OSNs\} (Ho-OSNs) located in the most ventral olfactory receptor zone can mediate distinct signaling pathways when activated by structurally similar ligands. Calcium imaging showed that Ho-OSNs were highly sensitive to 2-heptanone, heptaldehyde and cis-4-heptenal. 2-heptanone-evoked intracellular calcium elevation was mediated by cAMP signaling while heptaldehyde triggered the diacylglycerol pathway. An increase of intracellular calcium evoked by cis-4-heptenal was due to a combination of activation mediated by the adenylate cyclase pathway and suppression generated by phospholipase C signaling. Pharmacological studies demonstrated that novel mechanisms were involved in the phospholipase C-mediated intracellular calcium changes. Binary-mixture studies and cross-adaptation data indicate that three odorants acted on the same olfactory receptor. The feature that an olfactory receptor mediates multiple signaling pathways was specific for Ho-OSNs and not established in another population of \{OSNs\} characterized. Our study suggests that distinct signaling pathways triggered by ligand-induced conformational changes of an olfactory receptor constitute a complex information process mechanism in olfactory transduction. This study has important implications beyond olfaction in that it provides insights of plasticity and complexity of G-protein-coupled receptor activation and signal transduction. "

The numerous spines on their dendrites render them capable of integrating cortical glutamatergic inputs with a motivational dopaminergic signal that originates in the midbrain. This integrative function is thought to underly attribution of incentive salience, a process that is severely disrupted in schizophrenic patients. Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is located mainly to the striatal medium spiny neurons and hydrolyses cAMP and cGMP, key determinants of \{MSN\} signaling. We show here that genetic depletion of \{PDE10A\} critically mediates attribution of salience to reward-predicting cues, evident in impaired performance in \{PDE10A\} knockout mice in an instrumentally conditioned reinforcement task. We furthermore report modest impairment of latent inhibition in \{PDE10A\} knockout mice, and unaltered prepulse inhibition. We suggest that the lack of effect on \{PPI\} is due to the pre-attentional nature of this task. Finally, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings and confirm suggested changes in intrinsic membrane excitability. A decrease in spontaneous firing in striatal medium spiny neurons was found. These data show that \{PDE10A\} plays a pivotal role in striatal signaling and striatum-mediated salience attribution. "

Some of the work has focused on the identification of factors that modulate its activity, but until now, no one has tried to identify the effect of motor ability on the \{MNS\} regions. The aim of the present work is to study a possible modulation of hand dexterity on the \{MNS\} activity. A blocked fMRI experiment has been designed, consisting of an execution condition, where participants must repeatedly perform a precision grasping pantomime, and an observation condition, where the same motor action is passively observed. A conjunction analysis was performed in order to confirm the existence of mirror activity. Moreover, participants were classified depending on their hand dexterity (measured with the Purdue Pegboard Test) as “High dexterity” or “Low dexterity” and a regression analysis was performed to investigate a possible linear relationship between the degree of dexterity and brain activity in the MNS. The conjunction analysis revealed, as expected, activity in the inferior parietal lobule, a region that constitutes one of the nuclei of the putative \{MNS\} and which is consistently activated by intransitive actions. The degree of dexterity only seems to modulate \{MNS\} regions during action execution. However, under the observation condition, no linear relationship of hand dexterity in \{MNS\} regions was registered in either the comparison between groups, or in the regression analysis. Therefore, the \{MNS\} network does not seem to be linearly modulated by the degree of motor dexterity, as occurs with other action-related factors like familiarity. "

In the present work, we evaluated whether the factors released by ventral midbrain-challenged cells were able to alter \{GDNF\} expression in striatal cells, the targets of dopaminergic neurons projecting from the substantia nigra, and investigated the signalling pathways involved. Our data showed that soluble mediators released upon H2O2- or l-DOPA-induced dopaminergic injury up-regulated \{GDNF\} in striatal cells, with different temporal patterns depending on the oxidative agent used. Conditioned media from H2O2- or l-DOPA-challenged midbrain astrocyte cultures failed to up-regulate \{GDNF\} in striatal cultures. Likewise, there was no direct effect of \{H2O2\} or l-DOPA on striatal \{GDNF\} levels suggesting that \{GDNF\} up-regulation was mediated by soluble factors released in the presence of failing dopaminergic neurons. Both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were involved in striatal \{GDNF\} up-regulation triggered by H2O2-induced dopaminergic injury, while diffusible factors released in the presence of l-DOPA-challenged dopaminergic neurons induced \{GDNF\} expression in striatal cells through the activation of the \{MAPK\} pathway. These soluble mediators may constitute, in the future, important targets for the control of endogenous \{GDNF\} expression enabling the development of new and, hopefully, more efficient neuroprotective/neurorestorative strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Application of up to 100 µM hydrogen peroxide did not affect the cell viability for up to 4 h, but caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the extracellular glutathione (GSH) content that was accompanied by a matching decrease in the cellular \{GSH\} content. Hydrogen peroxide at 100 µM stimulated maximally the \{GSH\} export from viable neurons, but did not affect \{GSH\} export from cultured astrocytes. The peroxide-induced extracellular \{GSH\} accumulation from neurons was lowered by 70% in the presence of MK571, an inhibitor of multidrug resistance protein (Mrp) 1. The extracellular \{GSH\} content determined after 4 h of incubation was already significantly increased after a 5-min exposure of neurons to hydrogen peroxide and became maximal after 15 min of peroxide application. These data demonstrate that just a short exposure of viable cerebellar granule neurons to micromolar concentrations of hydrogen peroxide stimulates a prolonged Mrp1-mediated export of cellular GSH. This process may compromise the antioxidative potential of neurons and increase their sensitivity toward drugs and toxins. "

Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), the gene product lost in Fragile X syndrome (FXS), acts as an activity sensor during critical period development, both as an RNA-binding translation regulator and channel-binding excitability regulator. Here, we employ a Drosophila \{FXS\} disease model to assay calcium signaling dynamics with a targeted transgenic \{GCaMP\} reporter during critical period development of the mushroom body (MB) learning/memory circuit. We find \{FMRP\} regulates depolarization-induced calcium signaling in a neuron-specific manner within this circuit, suppressing activity-dependent calcium transients in excitatory cholinergic \{MB\} input projection neurons and enhancing calcium signals in inhibitory \{GABAergic\} \{MB\} output neurons. Both changes are restricted to the developmental critical period and rectified at maturity. Importantly, conditional genetic (dfmr1) rescue of null mutants during the critical period corrects calcium signaling defects in both neuron classes, indicating a temporally restricted \{FMRP\} requirement. Likewise, conditional dfmr1 knockdown (RNAi) during the critical period replicates constitutive null mutant defects in both neuron classes, confirming cell-autonomous requirements for \{FMRP\} in developmental regulation of calcium signaling dynamics. Optogenetic stimulation during the critical period enhances depolarization-induced calcium signaling in both neuron classes, but this developmental change is eliminated in dfmr1 null mutants, indicating the activity-dependent regulation requires FMRP. These results show \{FMRP\} shapes neuron class-specific calcium signaling in excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons in developing learning/memory circuitry, and that \{FMRP\} mediates activity-dependent regulation of calcium signaling specifically during the early-use critical period.

During the differentiation process (days 11–20) a strong increase in calcium responses to glutamate, acetylcholine and \{GABA\} were observed. Moreover, neuron specific marker proteins, β-III-tubulin, MAP2, Tau, Rbfox3 and synaptophysin showed similar patterns to pCN. In \{ESCN\} and pCN the neuronal structure, e.g. neurites, was not affected by low concentrations of \{ACR\} [0.5–1.6 mM]. However, 24 h incubation periods with 0.5–1.6 mM \{ACR\} led to a reduction of acetylcholine and glutamate induced calcium responses. In conclusion, we show that non-cytotoxic concentrations of \{ACR\} alter neurotransmission in \{ESCN\} as well as pCN. "

Previous studies demonstrated that typical antipsychotics could inhibit neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC). However, \{EPS\} typically emerge only upon prolonged exposure. As a result, we examined effects of haloperidol, a prototype typical antipsychotic, on neuronal \{VGSC\} upon incubation for varying duration. Briefly, \{VGSC\} currents were activated and recorded using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique in primary culture of mouse cortical neurons. \{VGSC\} activity was inhibited by acute haloperidol exposure (for minutes), but enhanced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by chronic haloperidol exposure (for hours). The effects of chronic haloperidol were associated with increased expression of \{VGSC\} subunits as well as corresponding electrophysiological channel properties. In summary, we found enhanced \{VGSC\} currents upon chronic haloperidol exposure in cortical neurons in contrast to inhibition by acute haloperidol exposure. Such a results may contribute to \{EPS\} of typical antipsychotics. "

Receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) has been reported as an important necroptosis pathway mediator that can be blocked by necrostatin-1 (Nec-1). In our study, we sought to identify whether necroptosis participated in \{SGN\} injury. Ouabain was applied to establish an \{SGN\} injury model. We measured the auditory brain-stem response (ABR) threshold shift as an indicator of the auditory conditions. Positive β3-tubulin immunofluorescence staining indicated the surviving SGNs. \{RIP3\} expression was evaluated using immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot. \{SGN\} injury promoted an increase in \{RIP3\} expression that could be suppressed by application of the necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1. A decreased \{ABR\} threshold shift and increased \{SGN\} density were observed when Nec-1 was administered with apoptosis inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD). These results demonstrated that necroptosis is an indispensable pathway separately from apoptosis leading to \{SGN\} death pathway, in which \{RIP3\} plays an important role. "

Therefore, understanding how endocannabinoids are mobilized to modulate synaptic inputs impinging on midbrain dopamine neurons is crucial to a complete understanding of the roles that these molecules play in reward behavior, drug abuse and addiction. Here we summarize the literature describing short-term and long-term regulation of afferent connections on dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area via endocannabinoid activation of cannabinoid \{CB1\} receptors, and describe the mechanisms through which these molecules are released during reward-based behavior and exposure to abused drugs.

Our research demonstrates the origin that there exist very rich nonlinear dynamics and complex biological firing regimes lies in different domains and their boundary curves in the two dimensional parameter plane. We present the parameter domains of fixed points, the saddle-node bifurcation, the supercritical/subcritical Neimark–Sacker bifurcation, stability conditions of non hyperbolic fixed points and quasiperiodic solutions. Based on these parameter domains, it is easy to know that the Rulkov chaotic neuron model can produce what kinds of firing regimes as well as their transition mechanisms.

Gas6 null mice showed delayed vaginal opening and delayed first estrus. Animals eventually attained normal estrous cycles as adults. The GnRH neuronal population was significantly decreased in Gas6 null adults and embryos, but the final positioning of cell bodies in the hypothalamus was normal. Vaginal tissue showed up-regulation of \{TAM\} receptor mRNAs in the absence of the ligand. These data confirm that Gas6 plays a role in early GnRH neuronal development and during vaginal opening.

Here, we trained mice to lick a reward spout in response to whisker deflection, and we recorded from genetically defined \{GABAergic\} inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV), vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP), and somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons displayed distinct action potential firing dynamics during task performance. Whereas \{SST\} neurons fired at low rates, both \{PV\} and \{VIP\} neurons fired at high rates both spontaneously and in response to whisker stimulation. After an initial outcome-invariant early sensory response, \{PV\} neurons had lower firing rates in hit trials compared to miss trials. Optogenetic inhibition of \{PV\} neurons during this time period enhanced behavioral performance. Hence, \{PV\} neuron activity might contribute causally to gating the sensorimotor transformation of a whisker sensory stimulus into licking motor output. "

An interesting observation is that spontaneous \{CDPs\} are not rhythmically superimposed on the sinusoidal \{CDPs\} generated during fictive scratching episodes, thus suggesting that the interneurons producing both types of \{CDPs\} belong to different spinal circuits. In order to provide experimental data to support this hypothesis, we recorded unitary activity of neurons in the \{L6\} spinal cord segment. We found that the neurons firing rhythmically during the sinusoidal \{CDPs\} associated with the extensor, flexor or intermediate phases of scratching were not synchronized with the spontaneous CDPs. Moreover, we found that the neurons firing during the spontaneous \{CDPs\} were not synchronized with the sinusoidal CDPs. These results suggest that the neurons involved in the occurrence of spontaneous \{CDPs\} are not part of the spinal cord central pattern generators (CPGs).

To provide new insight into the mechanism by which mutant \{SOD1\} induces motor neuron injury, we developed novel Caenorhabditis elegans models of ALS. Expression of human wild type or \{G93A\} \{SOD1\} specifically in motor neurons of C. elegans caused progressive locomotion defect and paralytic phenotype, which recapitulate some characteristic features of \{ALS\} including age-dependent motor dysfunction and degeneration of motor neurons associated with \{SOD1\} aggregation. In addition, the motor neuron loss is independent of cell death protein 3 (CED-3)/cell death protein 4 (CED-4) caspase pathway. We also found that before motor neurons began to die in adulthood, axon guidance defect of motor neuron appeared during the development stages. When green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins related to axon guidance were examined in motor neurons, a significantly decreased density and number of GFP-tagged puncta were observed in the transgenic worms. Our models mimic axon developmental defect and the adult-onset degeneration of motor neurons in ALS. Using this model, we uncovered the cell-autonomous damage caused by human \{SOD1\} to motor neurons in vivo, and provided a new insight into the developmental defect mechanism that may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

abstract = "Recent data have emphasized that the gastrointestinal nervous system is preponderant in the sensing of nutrients and hormones and its translation in terms of control of food intake by the central nervous system. More specifically, the gastrointestinal neural system participates in the control of hunger via the sensing of at least two major macronutrients, e.g. glucose and protein, which may control hunger sensations from the portal vein. Protein are first sensed by mu-opioid receptors present in the portal vein walls to induce intestinal gluconeogenesis-via a reflex arc and next portal glucose sensing. The gastrointestinal nervous system may also account for the rapid benefits of gastric bypass surgeries on energy homeostasis (hunger and body weight) and glucose homeostasis (insulin sensitivity). This knowledge provides novel mechanisms of control of body weight, which might be useful to envision future approaches of prevention or treatment of obesity. "

However, the electrophysiological properties and function of \{GABAA\} receptor in \{MPG\} neurons innervating bladder remain unknown. This study examined the electrophysiological properties and functional roles of \{GABAA\} receptors in bladder-innervating neurons identified by retrograde Dil tracing. Neurons innervating bladder showed previously established parasympathetic properties, including small membrane capacitance, lack of T-type Ca2+ channel expression, and tyrosine-hydroxylase immunoreactivity. \{GABAA\} receptors were functionally expressed in bladder innervating neurons, but \{GABAC\} receptors were not. \{GABA\} elicited strong depolarization followed by increase of intracellular Ca2+ in neurons innervating bladder, supporting the hypothesis \{GABA\} may play an important role in bladder function. These results provide useful information about the autonomic function of bladder in physiological and pathological conditions. "

Among \{KPM\} is xanthurenic acid (XA) deriving from the catabolism of 3-hydroxykynurenine. Based on its chemical structure, \{XA\} appears as a close analog of kynurenic acid which has been extensively investigated and is considered as a potent neuroprotective compound. Contrary to kynurenine acid, \{XA\} has received little attention and its role in the brain remains not elucidated. We have previously described several characteristics of XA, suggesting its possible involvement in neurotransmission. \{XA\} is also proposed as a potential modulator at glutamatergic synapses. Here, we used a selective antibody against \{XA\} and various neuronal, glial and synaptic markers to show that \{XA\} is essentially localized in the soma and dendrites of brain neurons, but is absent from axonal compartments and terminal endings. Our results also reveal that XA-like immunoreactivity is not expressed by glial cells. To double-check our findings, we have also used another \{XA\} antibody obtained from a commercial source to confirm the neuronal expression of XA. Together, our results suggest that, differently to several other \{KPM\} produced by glial cells, \{XA\} exhibits a neuronal distribution in the mouse brain. "

Reelin is not only important in cerebral cortical migration, but has recently been shown to interact with the Notch signaling pathway and to be critical for radial glial cell number and morphology. Lee and Song (2013) show a new Notch- and Reelin-dependent role for radial glia in the mouse spinal cord: to act as a fine filter that allows somatic motor neuron axons but not cell bodies to traverse out of the CNS. Here, the types of neuronal migration are discussed, focusing on motor neurons and cues for proper localization. The interaction of Reelin signaling with the Notch pathway is reviewed, which dictates the proper formation of radial glia in the spinal cord in order to prevent ectopic motor neuron migration (Lee and Song, 2013). Future studies may reveal novel interactions and further insights as to how Reelin functions throughout the developing nervous system. "

Punctate P2X4-R labeling was largely localized to the inner and outer plexiform layers of mouse, rat and cat retinae. In the mouse outer retina, double-labeling of P2X4-R with the horizontal cell marker, calbindin, revealed P2X4-R immunoreactivity (P2X4-R-IR) on horizontal cell somata and processes. In the inner retina, P2X4-R expression was found closely associated with rod and cone bipolar cell terminals, and the punctate labeling was observed on calretinin-positive amacrine cells. Using immuno-electron microscopy, P2X4-Rs were observed on processes post-synaptic to photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminals, likely representing horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells, respectively. Furthermore, P2X4-R expression was also observed on Müller cells, astrocytes and microglia. These data suggest a role for P2X4-Rs in the lateral inhibitory pathways of the retina, modulating neuronal function of photoreceptors and bipolar cells. The expression on macro- and microglial cells implicates a role for P2X4-Rs in glial signaling, tissue homeostasis and immunosurveillance within the mammalian retina. "

Final iN purity and conversion efficiency were increased on micrograting substrates. Neurite branching was increased on microposts and decreased on microgratings, with a simplified dendritic arbor characterized by the reduction of MAP2+ neurites. Neurite outgrowth increased significantly on various topographies. \{DNA\} microarray analysis detected 20 differentially expressed genes in iNs reprogrammed on smooth versus microgratings, and quantitative \{PCR\} (qPCR) confirmed the upregulation of Vip and downregulation of Thy1 and Bmp5 on microgratings. Electrophysiology and calcium imaging verified the functionality of these iNs. This study demonstrates the potential of applying topographical cues to optimize cellular reprogramming. "

Glucoprivic signals from the caudal hindbrain restrain this surge, but the cellular source of this stimulus is unclear. Norepinephrine (NE) exerts well-defined stimulatory effects on the reproductive neuroendocrine axis. Our studies show that medullary \{A2\} noradrenergic neurons are both estrogen- and glucoprivic-sensitive. Here, we investigated the premise that the \{LH\} surge is inhibited by \{A2\} cell reactivity to hindbrain glucopenia and diminished preoptic \{NE\} neurotransmission. Estradiol- and progesterone-primed ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were injected into the caudal fourth ventricle (CV4) with the glucose anti-metabolite, 5-thioglucose (5TG) or saline (SAL) prior to onset of the \{LH\} surge. Pretreatment by intra-CV4 delivery of the selective catecholamine neurotoxin, 6-OHDA, attenuated \{LH\} output, but prevented inhibition by 5TG. 5TG modified patterns of steroid feedback-associated Fos staining of A2, but not other medullary catecholamine cell groups. Intra-preoptic administration of the alpha1-adrenergic receptor agonist, methoxamine, elicited site-specific reversal of hindbrain glucoprivic suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron Fos labeling and \{LH\} release. Western blotting of laser-microdissected \{A2\} neurons revealed glucoprivic stimulation of Fos, but inhibition of the catecholamine synthetic enzyme, dopamine-β-hydroxylase; 5TG also diminished \{A2\} estrogen receptor (ER)-α and progesterone receptor profiles, but augmented ER-β protein. Intriguingly, \{A2\} \{AMPK\} activity was decreased in 5TG-treated rats, despite down-regulation of \{GLUT3\} and no change in \{MCT2\} protein expression. Rostral preoptic GnRH neurons also exhibited decreased \{AMPK\} activation simultaneous with apparent reduction of neuropeptide signaling to the pituitary. The present studies demonstrate that hindbrain glucoprivation inhibits the \{LH\} surge, in part, by reducing preoptic noradrenergic input, and furthermore implicate \{A2\} neurons as a source of this altered signal. Results also suggest that \{AMPK\} sensor deactivation does not supersede the impact of pharmacological inhibition of glucose catabolism on \{A2\} cell function nor afferent signaling of hindbrain glucopenia on GnRH neurons. Further studies are needed to determine if decreased \{AMPK\} activation in these cell populations reflect compensatory gain in positive energy balance and/or direct effects of estrogen on AMPK. "

We found that overnight treatment of \{DRG\} cultures with a cocktail of inflammatory mediators bradykinin (BK), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), norepinephrine (NE) and prostaglandin \{E2\} (PGE2) strongly increased the population size of the small-diameter neurons displaying low-voltage activated (LVA, T-type) Ca2+ currents while having no effect on the peak \{LVA\} current amplitude.

Inflammatory treatment did not affect CaV3.2 mRNA or protein levels in \{DRG\} cultures. Furthermore, an ubiquitination inhibitor, MG132, did not increase the population of LVA-positive neurons.

The levels of PTEN, AKT, and their phosphorylated forms were evaluated, along with the nuclear localization of NF-κB, to assess pathway activation. The induction of a neuroinflammatory response was determined by measuring TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA and protein levels. The results indicated that while \{LPS\} stimulation had no effect on \{PTEN\} and \{AKT\} expression, the levels of phosphorylated \{PTEN\} (pPTEN) decreased, while phosphorylated \{AKT\} (pAKT) levels increased. Moreover, \{LPS\} treatment induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and increased the expression and secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β. Blocking \{TLR4\} increased the levels of pPTEN and decreased the levels of pAKT, while pre-treatment with bpV(pic) led to a reduction in levels of pPTEN and pAKT. Furthermore, treatment with \{TLR4\} antibody, bpV(pic), and \{PDTC\} decreased LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and resulted in a downregulation of TNF-α and IL-1β expression. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a TLR4-mediated PTEN/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway in rat hippocampal neurons, which is associated with the activation of a neuroinflammatory response.

We visualized synapses in which postsynaptic neurons receive the sensory feedback, by using FM1-43 dye to label the synapses of both motor and sensory pathways that are associated with locomotion, then clearing the motor pathway synapse labeling, and finally identifying the target synapses by distinguishing physiologically functional synapses through destaining using a high-K+ solution. A pair of synaptic regions associated with the sensory feedback was found to be located two or three cell body-widths away from the midline, between the anterior parts of the roots of the second lateral nerves (LNs) at the segmental ganglia (SGs). Using conventional intracellular recording and dye loading of the cell bodies surrounding these synaptic regions, we identified a pair of bilateral neurons with cell bodies larger than those of other cells in these regions, and named them “Oscillatory firing neurons Projecting to Peripheral nerves” (OPPs). These had a bipolar shape and projected neurites to the ipsilateral first and third LNs, fired rhythmically, and had a burst timing synchronized with the motor pattern bursts from the ipsilateral first LNs. Current injection into an \{OPP\} caused firing in the ipsilateral first LNs, supporting the hypothesis that \{OPPs\} functionally project to the peripheral nerves. \{OPPs\} also sent neurites to the adjacent anterior and posterior SGs, suggesting connections with the adjacent segments. We conclude that \{FM\} imaging can be used to identify neurons involved in specific functions, and that \{OPPs\} are the first neurons to be associated with OA-induced locomotion in the earthworm. "

abstract = "Abstract Synapses transmitting nociceptive information in the spinal dorsal horn undergo enduring changes following peripheral nerve injury. Indeed, such injury alters the expression of the GluA2 subunit of glutamatergic \{AMPA\} receptors (AMPARs) in the substantia gelatinosa and this predicts altered channel conductance and calcium permeability, leading to an altered function of excitatory synapses. We therefore investigated the functional properties of synaptic \{AMPA\} receptors in rat substantia gelatinosa neurons following 10–20 d chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve; a model of neuropathic pain. We measured their single-channel conductance and sensitivity to a blocker of calcium permeable \{AMPA\} receptors (CP-AMPARs), \{IEM1460\} (50 μM). In putative inhibitory, tonic firing neurons, \{CCI\} reduced the average single-channel conductance of synaptic \{AMPAR\} from 14.4 ± 3.5 pS (n = 12) to 9.2 ± 1.0 pS (n = 10, p &lt; 0.05). \{IEM1460\} also more effectively antagonized evoked, spontaneous and miniature \{EPSCs\} in tonic neurons from sham operated animals than in those from animals that had been subjected to CCI. By contrast, \{CCI\} did not change the effectiveness of \{IEM1460\} in delay firing neurons although average single channel conductance was increased from 7.6 ± 1.2 pS (n = 11) to 12.2 ± 1.5 pS (n = 10, p &lt; 0.01). \{CCI\} thus elicits plastic changes in a specific set of glutamatergic synapses of substantia gelatinosa due to subunit recomposition and loss of GluA2-lacking CP-AMPAR. These insights reveal a molecular mechanism of nerve injury acting at synapses of inhibitory neurons to reduce their drive and therefore inhibitory tone in the spinal cord, therefore contributing to the central sensitization associated with neuropathic pain.

Despite widespread use of this noninvasive brain modulation technique, a generalizable explanation of its biophysical basis has not been described which seriously restricts its application and development. This paper investigated the dynamical behaviors of Hodgkin’s three classes of neurons exposed to \{DC\} electric field based on a conductance-based neuron model. With phase plane and bifurcation analysis, the different responses of each class of neuron to the same stimulation are shown to derive from distinct spike initiating dynamics. Under the effects of negative \{DC\} electric field, class 1 neuron generates repetitive spike through a saddle-node on invariant circle (SNIC) bifurcation, while it ceases this repetitive behavior through a Hopf bifurcation; Class 2 neuron generates repetitive spike through a Hopf bifurcation, meanwhile it ceases this repetitive behavior also by a Hopf bifurcation; Class 3 neuron can generate single spike through a quasi-separatrix-crossing (QSC) at first, then it generates repetitive spike through a Hopf bifurcation, while it ceases this repetitive behavior through a \{SNIC\} bifurcation. Furthermore, three classes of neurons’ spiking frequency f–electric field E (f–E) curves all have parabolic shape. Our results highlight the effects of external \{DC\} electric field on neuronal activity from the biophysical modeling point of view. It can contribute to the application and development of noninvasive \{DC\} brain modulation technique. "

To date, the drugs used for \{PD\} treatment provide only symptomatic relief. The identification of new drugs that show benefit in slowing the decline seen in \{PD\} patients is the focus of much current research. Acetylcorynoline is the major alkaloid component derived from Corydalis bungeana, a traditional Chinese medical herb. It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, but no studies have yet described the effects of acetylcorynoline on PD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for acetylcorynoline to improve \{PD\} in Caenorhabditis elegans models. In the present study, we used a pharmacological strain (BZ555) that expresses green fluorescent protein specifically in dopaminergic neurons, and a transgenic strain (OW13) that expresses human α-synuclein in muscle cells to study the antiparkinsonian effects of acetylcorynoline. Our experimental data showed that treatment with up to 10 mM acetylcorynoline does not cause toxicity in animals. Acetylcorynoline significantly decreases dopaminergic neuron degeneration induced by 6-hydroxydopamine in \{BZ555\} strain; prevents α-synuclein aggregation; recovers lipid content in \{OW13\} strain; restores food-sensing behavior, and dopamine levels; and prolongs life-span in 6-hydroxydopamine-treated \{N2\} strain, thus showing its potential as a possible antiparkinsonian drug. Acetylcorynoline may exert its effects by decreasing egl-1 expression to suppress apoptosis pathways and by increasing rpn5 expression to enhance the activity of proteasomes. "

This hypoalgesic effect has previously been attributed to alterations in peripheral and/or central pain processing. The objective of this study was to determine whether thrust magnitude of a simulated HVLA-SM alters mechanical trunk response thresholds in wide dynamic range (WDR) and/or nociceptive specific (NS) lateral thalamic neurons. Methods Extracellular recordings were carried out in the thalamus of 15 anesthetized Wistar rats. Lateral thalamic neurons having receptive fields, which included the lumbar dorsal-lateral trunk, were characterized as either \{WDR\} (n = 22) or \{NS\} (n = 25). Response thresholds to electronic von Frey (rigid tip) mechanical trunk stimuli were determined in 3 directions (dorsal-ventral, 45° caudalward, and 45° cranialward) before and immediately after the dorsal-ventral delivery of a 100-millisecond HVLA-SM at 3 thrust magnitudes (control, 55%, 85% body weight). Results There was a significant difference in mechanical threshold between 85% body weight manipulation and control thrust magnitudes in the dorsal-ventral direction in \{NS\} neurons (P = .01). No changes were found in \{WDR\} neurons at either HVLA-SM thrust magnitude. Conclusions This study is the first to investigate the effect of HVLA-SM thrust magnitude on \{WDR\} and \{NS\} lateral thalamic mechanical response threshold. Our data suggest that, at the single lateral thalamic neuron level, there may be a minimal spinal manipulative thrust magnitude required to elicit an increase in trunk mechanical response thresholds.

Neurodegenerative \{MNDs\} include pure hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), which involves specific degeneration of UMNs, leading to progressive spasticity of the lower limbs. In contrast, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) involves the specific degeneration of LMNs, with symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult-onset MND, is characterized by the degeneration of both \{UMNs\} and LMNs, leading to progressive muscle weakness, atrophy, and spasticity. A review of the comparative neuroanatomy of the human and zebrafish motor systems showed that, while the zebrafish was a homologous model for \{LMN\} disorders, such as SMA, it was only partially relevant in the case of \{UMN\} disorders, due to the absence of corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts in its central nervous system. Even considering the limitation of this model to fully reproduce the human \{UMN\} disorders, zebrafish offer an excellent alternative vertebrate model for the molecular and genetic dissection of \{MND\} mechanisms. Its advantages include the conservation of genome and physiological processes and applicable in vivo tools, including easy imaging, loss or gain of function methods, behavioral tests to examine changes in motor activity, and the ease of simultaneous chemical/drug testing on large numbers of animals. This facilitates the assessment of the environmental origin of MNDs, alone or in combination with genetic traits and putative modifier genes. Positive hits obtained by phenotype-based small-molecule screening using zebrafish may potentially be effective drugs for treatment of human MNDs. "

It remains however unknown whether the deficit of cerebellar CaV2.1 in adult is in direct link with the disease. To address this issue, we have used lentiviral based-vector \{RNA\} interference (RNAi) to knock-down CaV2.1 expression in the cerebellum of adult mice. We show that suppression of the P/Q-type channels in Purkinje neurons induced motor abnormalities, such as imbalance and ataxic gait. Interestingly, moderate channel suppression caused no basal ataxia, while β-adrenergic activation and exercise mimicked stress induced motor disorders. Moreover, stress-induced ataxia was stable, non-progressive and totally abolished by acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to treat EA2. Altogether, these data reveal that P/Q-type channel suppression in adult mice supports the episodic status of \{EA2\} disease. "

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-204 and \{TMPRSS3\} in SGNs. Effect of miR-204 on cell viability of \{SGNs\} was first examined using \{MTT\} (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Expression of \{TMPRSS3\} in \{SGNs\} with or without addition of miR-204 was assessed by real-time \{PCR\} and western blot further. A luciferase reporter activity assay was conducted to confirm target association between miR-204 and 3′-UTR of TMPRSS3. Finally, role of \{TMPRSS3\} on cell viability of \{SGNs\} was evaluated by transfection of \{TMPRSS3\} siRNA. Cell viability of \{SGNs\} was suppressed by miR-204 in a concentration-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-204 reduced expression of \{TMPRSS3\} in \{SGNs\} at both mRNA and protein levels. Binding to the 3′-UTR of \{TMPRSS3\} by miR-204 was identified by luciferase assay. Knockdown of \{TMPRSS3\} by siRNA significantly inhibits cell viability of SGNs. miR-204 could be a potential therapeutic target in sensorineural hearing loss. "

abstract = "Abstract Serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus, with their extensive innervation of limbic and higher brain regions and interactions with the endocrine system have important modulatory or regulatory effects on many cognitive, emotional and physiological processes. They have been strongly implicated in responses to stress and in the occurrence of major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. In order to quantify some of these effects, detailed mathematical models of the activity of such cells are required which describe their complex neurochemistry and neurophysiology. We consider here a single-compartment model of these neurons which is capable of describing many of the known features of spike generation, particularly the slow rhythmic pacemaking activity often observed in these cells in a variety of species. Included in the model are 11 kinds of ion channels: a fast sodium current INa, a delayed rectifier potassium current IKDR, a transient potassium current IA, a slow non-inactivating potassium current IM, a low-threshold calcium current IT, two high threshold calcium currents \{IL\} and IN, small and large conductance potassium currents \{ISK\} and IBK, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current \{IH\} and a leak current ILeak. In Sections 3–8, each current type is considered in detail and parameters estimated from voltage clamp data where possible. Three kinds of model are considered for the \{BK\} current and two for the leak current. Intracellular calcium ion concentration Cai is an additional component and calcium dynamics along with buffering and pumping is discussed in Section 9. The remainder of the article contains descriptions of computed solutions which reveal both spontaneous and driven spiking with several parameter sets. Attention is focused on the properties usually associated with these neurons, particularly long duration of action potential, steep upslope on the leading edge of spikes, pacemaker-like spiking, long-lasting afterhyperpolarization and the ramp-like return to threshold after a spike. In some cases the membrane potential trajectories display doublets or have humps or notches as have been reported in some experimental studies. The computed time courses of \{IA\} and \{IT\} during the interspike interval support the generally held view of a competition between them in influencing the frequency of spiking. Spontaneous activity was facilitated by the presence of \{IH\} which has been found in these neurons by some investigators. For reasonable sets of parameters spike frequencies between about 0.6 Hz and 1.2 Hz are obtained, but frequencies as high as 6 Hz could be obtained with special parameter choices. Topics investigated and compared with experiment include shoulders, notches, anodal break phenomena, the effects of noradrenergic input, frequency versus current curves, depolarization block, effects of cell size and the effects of IM. The inhibitory effects of activating 5-HT1A autoreceptors are also investigated. There is a considerable discussion of in vitro versus in vivo firing behavior, with focus on the roles of noradrenergic input, corticotropin-releasing factor and orexinergic inputs. Location of cells within the nucleus is probably a major factor, along with the state of the animal. "

We model morphology with a novel formulation of Conditional Random Fields, a hierarchical latent-state CRF, to capture the highly varying compartment-based structure of the neurons (soma–axon–dendrites). In the training phase, we follow two approaches: (i) hierarchical learning, where compartment labels are given, and (ii) latent-state learning, where compartment labels are not given in the samples. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach using wild-type motor neurons in the larval ventral nerve cord. However, our method can also be used for the identification of motor neuron mutations, as well as the automated annotation of the motor circuitry in wild type and mutant animals. Our method is directly applicable to the recognition of compartment-defined structures. "

We find little if any specific, temporal mRNA co-regulation between individual \{RPTP\} and Ntrk genes between E12.5 and E14.5. Moreover, a double fluorescent in-situ hybridization and immunofluorescence study of seven Rptp genes with Ntrks revealed widespread co-expression of \{RPTPs\} in individual neurons, but no tight correlation with Trk expression profiles. No Rptp is expressed in 100% of Ntrk1-expressing neurons, whereas at least 6 \{RPTPs\} are expressed in 100% of Ntrk2- and Ntrk3-expressing neurons. An exception is Ptpro, which showed very selective expression. Short hairpin \{RNA\} suppression of Ptprf, Ptprs or Ptpro in primary, E13.5 \{DRG\} neurons did not alter \{TRK\} signalling. We therefore propose that \{TRK\} signalling may not be simply dependent on rate-limiting regulation by individual \{RPTP\} subtypes during sensory neuron development. Instead, \{TRK\} signalling has the potential to be buffered by concurrent inputs from several \{RPTPs\} in individual neurons. "

Characterization of the dbl-1 promoter indicates that CEH-28 targets an M4-specific enhancer within the dbl-1 promoter region, while expression in other neurons is mediated by separate regulatory sequences. Unlike ceh-28 mutants, dbl-1 mutants do not exhibit \{M4\} synaptic and signaling defects. Instead, both ceh-28 and dbl-1 mutants exhibit morphological defects in the g1 gland cells located adjacent to \{M4\} in the pharynx, and these defects can be partially rescued by M4-specific expression of dbl-1 in these mutants. Identical gland cell defects are observed in sma-6 and daf-4 mutants defective in the receptor for DBL-1, but they are not observed in sma-2 and sma-3 mutants lacking the R-Smads functioning downstream of this receptor. Together these results identify a novel neuroendocrine function for \{M4\} and provide evidence for an R-Smad-independent mechanism for DBL-1 signaling in C. elegans. "

It is observed that three classes of neurons can exhibit bursting, synchronous spiking and subthreshold oscillation when exposed to \{ELF\} induced EF. By analyzing neuronal spiking frequency and average firing rate, it is found that class 1 and 2 neurons could generate bursting with p:1 (p &gt; 1) phase-locking in the low \{EF\} frequency area when \{EF\} amplitude is above the stimulus spiking threshold, whereas class 3 neuron is not so sensitive to induced \{EF\} stimulus in this area unless the \{EF\} amplitude is much higher. With the increase of \{EF\} frequency, three classes of neurons all exhibit synchronous spiking with 1:1 phase-locking. When \{EF\} frequency further increases, the spiking frequency for three classes will drop to zero and neurons cease spiking. Our study suggests that the induced \{EF\} parameters can determine and be quantified by neuronal spiking patterns. It can contribute to reveal how \{EF\} stimulus is encoded by different neurons, which may aid the interpretation of the effects of electromagnetic fields on brain neurons. "

To reproduce in the mouse these hallmarks of diseases affecting motor neurons, we generated a mouse line in which ~ 40% of motor neurons in the spinal cord and the brainstem become unable to sustain neuromuscular transmission. These mice were obtained by conditional knockout of the gene encoding choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the biosynthetic enzyme for acetylcholine. The mutant mice are viable and spontaneously display abnormal phenotypes that worsen with age including hunched back, reduced lifespan, weight loss, as well as striking deficits in muscle strength and motor function. This slowly progressive neuromuscular dysfunction is accompanied by muscle fiber histopathological features characteristic of neurogenic diseases. Unexpectedly, most changes appeared with a 6-month delay relative to the onset of reduction in ChAT levels, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms preserve muscular function for several months and then are overwhelmed. Deterioration of mouse phenotype after ChAT gene disruption is a specific aging process reminiscent of human pathological situations, particularly among survivors of paralytic poliomyelitis. These mutant mice may represent an invaluable tool to determine the sequence of events that follow the loss of function of a motor neuron subset as the disease progresses, and to evaluate therapeutic strategies. They also offer the opportunity to explore fundamental issues of motor neuron biology. "

abstract = "Abstract Somatostatin (sst) is a cyclic neuropeptide known to have inhibitory roles in the central nervous system. It exerts its biological effects via the activation of the 5 sst receptor subtypes, which belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). This peptide has analgesic properties, specifically via the activation of the sst4 receptor subtype. Although this is established, the precise molecular mechanisms causing this have not yet been fully elucidated. This research aimed to identify a possible anti-nociceptive mechanism, showing functional links to the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) within the pain processing pathway. Calcium imaging and whole cell voltage clamp experiments were conducted on \{DRG\} neurons prepared from adult rats, utilizing capsaicin stimulations and the sst4 receptor specific agonist J-2156. The complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory pain model was used to examine if effects are augmented in pain conditions. The sst4 receptor agonist J-2156 was able significantly to inhibit capsaicin induced calcium and sodium influx, where the effect was more potent after \{CFA\} treatment. This inhibition identifies a contributory molecular mechanism to the analgesic properties of sst4 receptor activation. "

abstract = "Abstract This paper is concerned with understanding synthesis of electric signals in the neural system based on making pairwise comparisons. Fundamentally, every person and every animal is born with the talent to compare stimuli from things that share properties in space or over time. Comparisons always need experience to distinguish among things. Pairwise comparisons are numerically reciprocal. If a value is assigned to the larger of two elements that have a given property when compared with the smaller one, then the smaller has the reciprocal of that value when compared with the larger. Because making comparisons requires the reciprocal property, we need mathematics that can cope with division. There are four division algebras that would allow us to use our reciprocals arising from comparisons: The real numbers, the complex numbers, the non-commutative quaternions and the non-associative octonions. Rather than inferring function as from electric flow in a network, in this paper we infer the flow from function. Neurons fire in response to stimuli and their firings vary relative to the intensities of the stimuli. We believe neurons use some kind of pairwise comparison mechanism to determine when to fire based on the stimuli they receive. The ideas we develop here about flows are used to deduce how a system based on this kind of firing determination works and can be described. Furthermore the firing of neurons requires continuous comparisons. To develop a formula describing the output of these pairwise comparisons requires solving Fredholm’s equation of the second kind which is satisfied if and only if a simple functional equation has solutions. The Fourier transform of the real solution of this equation leads to inverse square laws like those that are common in physics. The Fourier transform applied to a complex valued solution leads to Dirac type of firings. Such firings are dense in the very general fields of functions known as Sobolev spaces and thus can be used to represent the very diverse phenomena in and around us. The non-commutative solution in quaternions can be interpreted as rotations in space. The also non-commutative and non-associative solution in octonions has yet to be adequately interpreted outside physics. "

The Lf-grafted liposomes carrying \{NGF\} (Lf/NGF-liposomes) were applied to a monolayer of human brain-microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) regulated by human astrocytes (HAs) and to fibrillar Aβ1-42-insulted SK-N-MC cells. An increase in cholesterol mole percentage enhanced the particle size, absolute value of zeta potential, and physical stability, however, reduced the entrapment efficiency and release rate of NGF. In addition, an increase in Lf concentration increased the particle size, surface nitrogen percentage, \{NGF\} permeability across the BBB, and viability of HBMECs, HAs, and SK-N-MC cells, however, decreased the absolute value of zeta potential, surface phosphorus percentage, and loading efficiency of Lf. After treating with Lf/NGF-liposomes, a higher Aβ concentration yielded a lower survival of SK-N-MC cells. The current Lf/NGF-liposomes are efficacious drug carriers to target the \{BBB\} and inhibit the Aβ-induced neurotoxicity as potential pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease. "

This yields a heterogeneous population of neuronal phenotypes and underlying astrocyte precursors, the latter of which are very difficult to visualise using standard light microscopy. Such a mixed culture is acceptable for some applications (e.g. measurement of synaptic plasticity), whereas others (e.g. proteomics or transcriptomics) require almost pure cultures of hNT neurons. New method Here we describe a simple method for obtaining highly enriched cultures of hNT neurons following the first neuronal harvest and detail several additional methods, namely flow-cytometry and xCELLigence© biosensor technology, to rapidly and reliably determine the purity and viability of the cultures. Comparison with existing methods This method of enrichment for the neurons is novel and advances the end user applications of the cells. Results In addition, we apply the enrichment method to conduct analysis of cell-surface markers using flow-cytometry on the enriched neuronal cells. Furthermore, we apply this method to generate enriched neuronal cells on which we conduct analysis of cell-surface markers using flow-cytometry. Conclusions Collectively, this paper describes several new advances, which will create opportunities when using these cells and similar preparations, and provides the protocol for analysis of these cells using flow-cytometry and biosensor technology.

Increased production of IL-1β in pain and inflammation such as headache is well documented. However, limited evidence addresses the participation of inflammasomes in inflammatory pain. The present study used rat inflammatory dural stimulation-induced model of intracranial pain to assess whether headache-related pain can induce the activation of NACHT, LRR, and PYD-containing protein (NALP)-3 inflammasome pathway in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) and which cells express \{NALP3\} inflammasome proteins and IL-1β. Chemical stimulation of the intracranial dura caused a total drug dose- and time-dependent induction of activated caspase-1 and mature IL-1β proteins. Application of a selective caspase-1 inhibitor diminished these effects. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both \{NALP3\} inflammasome and IL-1β immunoreactivity were existed mainly in small to medium-sized C-type neurons and increased over time, with intense cytoplasmic staining after 3 days of dural inflammation. Overall, the present observation indicated that dural inflammation promoted assembly of the multiprotein \{NALP3\} complex, activated caspase-1, and induced processing of IL-1β, which provides an indirect evidence of the participation of \{NALP3\} inflammasome in the cascade of events involved in the genesis of headaches by promoting IL-1β maturation in the TG. This may contribute to strategies for headache control. "

Moreover, some evidence implied that the hippocampus is associated with cognitive function. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of progesterone on hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo, and its inﬂuence on the cognitive outcome. In vitro, the model of primary cultured hippocampal neurons against glutamate-induced excitotoxic damage was used. After 10-day culture, neurons were pretreated with progesterone in a concentration 10 ng/ml, 48 h before a 5-min exposure to 200 μmol/l glutamate. Then 24 h after glutamate exposure, the nerve cells were observed and \{LDH\} was detected. The results showed progesterone protected the cultured hippocampal neurons morphology and significantly reduced the amount of LDH. In vivo, the model of \{TBI\} was established by modified Feeney's weight-dropping method. The progesterone was given in a dose of 16 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection 1 h post injury and subsequent injections subcutaneously at 6 h and 12 h after TBI. Brain samples were extracted at 24 h after injury. Histology and the iNOS expression were examined by Nissl stain, immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The cognitive outcome was assessed by Morris water maze test (MWM). The results revealed that the neuronal cell damage and the expression of iNOS in the hippocampus \{CA1\} were significantly decreased after progesterone administration. Progesterone significantly improved cognitive outcome after TBI. The results suggest that the positive effects of progesterone on cognitive outcome may be linked to protecting hippocampal neurons from secondary damage. "

Then the bursting patterns of the new model are investigated by using the bifurcation theory of fast-slow dynamical systems. Numerical simulation shows that the new model exhibits some bursting patterns that appear in some common neuron models with properly chosen parameters but do not exist in the corresponding integer-order M–L model. Further, on the basis of a comparison of the nonlinear dynamics between the fractional-order M–L model and the integer-order M–L model, we show that the fractional-order derivative can activate the slow potassium ion channel faster and play an important role to modulate the firing activity of the new model.

The \{PCG\} was then collected and processed for double-labeling immunofluorescence. T injections increased the T (∼3.5-fold) and estradiol-17β (∼1.6-fold) levels in the peripheral blood, and reduced the following in the PCG: the total number of Fast Blue-positive neurons, the number of perikarya in the lateral part of the PCG, the numbers of VAChT+/SOM+, VAChT+/VIP+, VAChT+/nNOS+, VAChT+/VIP−, VAChT+/DβH−, VAChT−/SOM−, VAChT−/VIP−, VAChT−/nNOS− and VAChT−/DβH− perikarya, In the T-affected PCG, the populations of ovarian perikarya coded VAChT−/SOM+, VAChT−/VIP+ and VAChT−/DβH+, and expressing androgen receptor were increased.

While it has been assumed that the basal ganglia play an important role in initiating these processes, the role of the striatal microstructure for these processes remains to be uncovered. Previous studies in basal ganglia diseases could not elucidate the relevance of the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) microstructure unambiguously because structural alterations occur together with alterations in various neurotransmitter systems. We present and examine a possible model that allows the examination of \{MSN\} dysfunction unbiased by other modulations, i.e. a case of ‘benign hereditary chorea’ (BHC) in comparison to healthy controls. We apply event-related potentials (ERPs) to uncover the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms underlying post-error behavioral adaptation. The \{BHC\} patient revealed a smaller error-related negativity (ERN) together with almost absent behavioral adaptation after an error and generally more error-prone behavior. Performance monitoring processes unrelated to errors, as well as response inhibition processes, were not affected in the \{BHC\} patient. The results suggest that the striatal \{MSN\} microstructural integrity is more important for error-related behavioral adaptation than for other response monitoring processes unrelated to errors. "

Cell apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining, \{TUNEL\} assay and flow cytometric analysis. Western blotting was applied for detecting protein levels of cellular signaling molecules. Key findings Our results showed that glutamate exposure significantly induces cell apoptosis, whereas the pretreatment of salidroside or \{MADP\} remarkably improves cell viability. Most importantly, the anti-apoptotic effect of \{MADP\} against glutamate insult is superior to salidroside. To explore the involved mechanisms, we measured some pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic protein levels, and several cell survival signaling pathways were analyzed as well. No visible alterations in Bcl-2 and Bax protein levels were observed by \{MADP\} or salidroside. Akt and \{JNK\} phosphorylation was robustly stimulated by \{MADP\} in the glutamate-treated neurons. Salidroside treatment results in a slight activation in Akt, while no significant alteration in \{JNK\} activity was observed. Significance \{MADP\} exhibits higher capacity to attenuate glutamate induced cell apoptosis in the cultured rat hippocampal neurons, suggesting that \{MADP\} might be a better candidate than salidroside for developing novel drugs treating neuron loss associated disorders.

Central nervous system neurons are otherwise difficult to obtain from patients with neurologic disorders; however, nonhuman models may not reflect patient pathology. Somatic cell reprogramming may afford models of nonfamilial “sporadic” neurologic disorders, which are likely caused by multiple interacting genetic and nongenetic factors.

In humans, the expression of Stil is involved in cancer cell survival, apoptosis and proliferation. In this research, we investigated the roles of Stil expression in cell proliferation of mammalian dopaminergic (DA) \{PC12\} cells. Stil functions through the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signal transduction pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation tests revealed that \{STIL\} interacts with Shh downstream components, which include \{SUFU\} and GLI1. By examining the expression of Stil, Gli1, CyclinD2 (cell-cycle marker) and \{PCNA\} (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), we found that up-regulation of Stil expression (transfection with overexpression plasmids) increased Shh signaling transduction and \{PC12\} cell proliferation, whereas down-regulation of Stil expression (by shRNA) inhibited Shh signaling transduction, and thereby decreased \{PC12\} cell proliferation. Transient transfection of \{PC12\} cells with Stil knockdown or overexpression plasmids did not affect \{PC12\} cell neural differentiation, further indicating the specific roles of Stil in cell proliferation. The results from this research suggest that Stil may serve as a bio-marker for neurological diseases involved in \{DA\} neurons, such as Parkinson’s disease. "

Since even brief disruption in phrenic neural activity is detrimental to life, on-going neural activity may play a key role in shaping phrenic motor output. To test the hypothesis that spinal mechanisms sense and respond to reduced phrenic activity, anesthetized, ventilated rats received micro-injections of procaine in the \{C2\} ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) to transiently (~ 30 min) block axon conduction in bulbospinal axons from medullary respiratory neurons that innervate one phrenic motor pool; during procaine injections, contralateral phrenic neural activity was maintained. Once axon conduction resumed, a prolonged increase in phrenic burst amplitude was observed in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve, demonstrating inactivity-induced phrenic motor facilitation (iPMF). Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and atypical \{PKC\} (aPKC) activity in spinal segments containing the phrenic motor nucleus impaired ipsilateral iPMF, suggesting a key role for spinal TNFα and aPKC in iPMF following unilateral axon conduction block. A small phrenic burst amplitude facilitation was also observed contralateral to axon conduction block, indicating crossed spinal phrenic motor facilitation (csPMF). csPMF was independent of spinal TNFα and aPKC. Ipsilateral iPMF and csPMF following unilateral withdrawal of phrenic synaptic inputs were associated with proportional increases in phrenic responses to chemoreceptor stimulation (hypercapnia), suggesting iPMF and csPMF increase phrenic dynamic range. These data suggest that local, spinal mechanisms sense and respond to reduced synaptic inputs to phrenic motor neurons. We hypothesize that iPMF and csPMF may represent compensatory mechanisms that assure adequate motor output is maintained in a physiological system in which prolonged inactivity ends life. "

Since it has been suggested that the autophagic defect may contribute to the neurodegeneration, we used cell cultures of NPC1-deficient and NPC1-wildtype neurons to investigate whether the disturbance influences neuronal survival. We found a genotype-dependent difference in survival, when autophagy is induced during culturing. NPC1-deficient neurons are more sensitive to rapamycin treatment and starvation than wildtype neurons. The subsequent search for defects in regulatory components of the autophagic pathway and the autophagic flux brought up results which differ from previous reports on somatic cells in one essential aspect: we exclude that an enhanced formation of autophagosomes contributes to the imbalanced autophagic flux in \{NPC1\} deficient neurons. We found that solely the clearance of autophagosomes is delayed in these cells, which leads to an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles within the lysosomal compartment. Lowering the abnormal lipid load of the acidic organelles with cyclodextrin is sufficient to correct the autophagic flux and prevents premature death of \{NPC1\} −/− neurons under autophagic stress. From our results, we conclude that a pharmacological intervention in the neuropathology of NPC-disease should focus on the restoration of the lysosomal degradation capacity of cells. "

As swallowing involves the transfer from a voluntary to a reflex movement, we considered that mirror neurons involved in swallowing may have special characteristics. To examine the characteristics of mirror neurons related to swallowing, we compared mirror neurons involved in swallowing and in finger movements. Materials and methods We examined 12 healthy individuals (6 men, 6 women; average age 23 years; right handed). Brain activities during presentations of swallowing and of finger movements were measured using 1.5-T functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results During presentation of a video for each stimulus, brain activation was observed in areas where mirror neurons are considered to be located, namely bilateral motor association areas (Brodmann area 44: inferior frontal gyrus, BA6: supplementary motor cortex) and bilateral parietal association areas (BA40). Activation was seen in the left ventral posterior cingulate gyrus (BA23) only during presentation of the video about swallowing. Activation of the left \{BA6\} was significant only during presentation of the video about swallowing. Conclusion This activity may not be present during finger movements and may be activations required by mirror neurons during a swallowing movement that involves a shift from a voluntary to a reflex movement.

Intradermal (id) microinjection of the pruritogens histamine, SLIGRL-NH2 (agonist of PAR-2 and MrgprC11) and chloroquine (agonist of MrgprA3) into the calf of the lower limb elicited significant biting and a small amount of licking directed to the injection site, over a 30-min time course. Following id injection of histamine, low-threshold mechanical stimuli reliably elicited discrete episodes of biting (alloknesis) over a longer time course; significantly less alloknesis was observed following id injection of SLIGRL-NH2. Capsaicin injections elicited licking but little biting. Following id injection of capsaicin, low-threshold mechanical stimuli elicited discrete hindlimb flinches (allodynia) over a prolonged (&gt;2 h) time course. In single-unit recordings from superficial lumbar dorsal horn neurons, low-threshold mechanically evoked responses were significantly enhanced, accompanied by receptive field expansion, following id injection of histamine in histamine-responsive neurons. This was not observed in histamine-insensitive neurons, or following id injection of saline or SLIGRL-NH2, regardless of whether the latter activated the neuron or not. These results suggest that itch-responsive neurons are selectively sensitized by histamine but not SLIGRL-NH2 to account for alloknesis. The presently described “calf” model appears to distinguish between itch- and pain-related behavioral responses, and provides a basis to investigate lumbar spinal neural mechanisms underlying itch, alloknesis, pain and allodynia.

Although previous studies have shown that the guidance molecules Netrin/DCC and Slit/Robo have critical roles in \{PCN\} migration, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Here, we report that draxin, a repulsive axon guidance protein, is involved in \{PCN\} development. We found that draxin is expressed in the rhombic lip and migratory stream of some \{PCN\} in the developing hindbrain of mice. In addition, draxin inhibited neurite outgrowth and nuclei migration from rhombic lip explants. These results suggest that draxin functions as a repulsive guidance cue for \{PCN\} migration. However, we observed no significant differences in \{PCN\} distribution between draxin−/− and wild type embryos. Thus, draxin and other axon guidance cues may have redundant roles in \{PCN\} migration. "

Here, we studied the role of \{DNA\} methylation and histone deacetylation in reactions of neurons and surrounding glial cells to photodynamic treatment that induces oxidative stress and cell death. Isolated crayfish stretch receptor consisting of a single mechanoreceptor neuron surrounded by glial cells was photosensitized with aluminum phthalocyanine Photosens that induced neuron inactivation, necrosis of the neuron and glia, and glial apoptosis. Inhibitors of \{DNA\} methylation 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine) reduced the level of PDT-induced necrosis of glial cells but not neurons by 1.3 and 2.0 times, respectively, and did not significantly influence apoptosis of glial cells. Histone deacetylase inhibitors valproic acid and trichostatin A inhibited PDT-induced both necrosis and apoptosis of satellite glial cells but not neurons by 1.6–2.7 times. Thus, in the crayfish stretch receptor \{DNA\} methylation and histone deacetylation are involved in epigenetic control of glial but not neuronal necrosis. Histone deacetylation also participates in glial apoptosis. "

To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes, it is essential to establish unbiased automated tools allowing the correlation of neurite morphology and the subcellular distribution of molecules by quantitative means. We developed NeuronAnalyzer2D, a plugin for ImageJ, which allows the extraction of neuronal cell morphologies from two dimensional high resolution images, and in particular their correlation with protein profiles determined by indirect immunostaining of primary neurons. The prominent feature of our approach is the ability to extract subcellular distributions of distinct biomolecules along neurites. To extract the complete areas of neurons, required for this analysis, we employ active contours with a new distance based energy. For locating the structural parts of neurons and various morphological parameters we adopt a wavelet based approach. The presented approach is able to extract distinctive profiles of several proteins and reports detailed morphology measurements on neurites. We compare the detected neurons from NeuronAnalyzer2D with those obtained by NeuriteTracer and Vaa3D-Neuron, two popular tools for automatic neurite tracing. The distinctive profiles extracted for several proteins, for example, of the mRNA binding protein ZBP1, and a comparative evaluation of the neuron segmentation results proves the high quality of the quantitative data and proves its practical utility for biomedical analyses.

Gastrodin is a main bioactive constituent of the traditional herbal Gastrodia elata Blume, which has been widely used in Oriental countries for centuries. As an analgesic, gastrodin has been used clinically to treat pain such as migraine and headache. However, the mechanisms underlying analgesic action of gastrodin are still poorly understood. Here, we have found that gastrodin inhibited the activity of native \{ASICs\} in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Gastrodin dose-dependently inhibited proton-gated currents mediated by ASICs. Gastrodin shifted the proton concentration–response curve downwards, with a decrease of 36.92±6.23% in the maximum current response but with no significant change in the pH0.5 value. Moreover, gastrodin altered acid-evoked membrane excitability of rat \{DRG\} neurons and caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of the depolarization and the number of action potentials induced by acid stimuli. Finally, peripheral applied gastrodin relieved pain evoked by intraplantar injection of acetic acid in rats. Our results indicate that gastrodin can inhibit the activity of \{ASICs\} in the primary sensory neurons, which provided a novel mechanism underlying analgesic action of gastrodin. "

However, how this affects protein repertoires at a single-cell level remains an open question. Here, we show that many 3′-terminal exons are persistently co-expressed with their alternatives in mammalian neurons. In an important example of this scenario, cell polarity gene Cdc42, a combination of polypyrimidine tract-binding, protein-dependent, and constitutive splicing mechanisms ensures a halfway switch from the general (E7) to the neuron-specific (E6) alternative 3′-terminal exon during neuronal differentiation. Perturbing the nearly equimolar E6/E7 ratio in neurons results in defects in both axonal and dendritic compartments and suggests that Cdc42E7 is involved in axonogenesis, whereas Cdc42E6 is required for normal development of dendritic spines. Thus, co-expression of a precise blend of functionally distinct splice isoforms rather than a complete switch from one isoform to another underlies proper structural and functional polarization of neurons.

Focal uncaging of glutamate evoked spatially-restricted glutamatergic responses on various dendritic locations of pyramidal neurons in the mPFC. Analyses of the spatial arrangements of the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits were performed by comparing inhibition of glutamatergic responses in the presence of the GluN2A-selective pharmacological antagonist, NVP-AAM077 (NVP), and the GluN2B-selective peptidic antagonist, conantokin-G (con-G). We found that apical and basal expression and distribution of GluN2A and GluN2B were similar in \{L5\} mPFC neurons of \{WT\} mice. However, the inhibition of glutamatergic responses by \{NVP\} in brain slices of GluN2A−/− mice were dramatically decreased, while con-G inhibition remained similar to that observed in \{WT\} brain slices. The data obtained show that expression and spatial arrangement of GluN2B subunits is independent of GluN2A in \{L5\} neurons of the mPFC. These findings have important ramifications for \{NMDAR\} organization and function in \{L5\} pyramidal neurons of the mPFC, and show that specific populations of \{NMDARs\} can be antagonized, while sparing other subgroups of NMDARs, thus preserving selective \{NMDAR\} functions, an important therapeutic advantage.

abstract = "Abstract Motor neurons in the vertebrate spinal cord are stereotypically organized along the rostro-caudal axis in discrete columns that specifically innervate peripheral muscle domains. Originating from the same progenitor domain, the generation of spinal motor neurons is orchestrated by a spatially and temporally tightly regulated set of secreted molecules and transcription factors such as retinoic acid and the Lim homeodomain transcription factors Isl1 and Lhx1. However, the molecular interactions between these factors remained unclear. In this study we examined the role of the microRNA 9 (miR-9) in the specification of spinal motor neurons and identified Onecut1 (OC1) as one of its targets. miR-9 and \{OC1\} are expressed in mutually exclusive patterns in the developing chick spinal cord, with high \{OC1\} levels in early-born motor neurons and high miR-9 levels in late-born motor neurons. miR-9 efficiently represses \{OC1\} expression in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of miR-9 leads to an increase in late-born neurons, while miR-9 loss-of-function induces additional OC1+ motor neurons that display a transcriptional profile typical of early-born neurons. These results demonstrate that regulation of \{OC1\} by miR-9 is a crucial step in the specification of spinal motor neurons and support a model in which miR-9 expression in late-born \{LMCl\} neurons downregulates Isl1 expression through inhibition of OC1. In conclusion, our study contributes essential factors to the molecular network specifying spinal motor neurons and emphasizes the importance of microRNAs as key players in the generation of neuronal diversity.

The extended amygdala has previously been demonstrated to mediate the response to both predator odor and the EPM. We seek to determine if divergent amygdalar microcircuits are associated with the different behavioral responses. The current experiments compared activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-containing neuronal populations in the central amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) of rats exposed to either the \{EPM\} (5 min) versus home cage controls, or predator (ferret) odor versus butyric acid, or no odor (30 min). Sections of the brains were prepared for dual-labeled immunohistochemistry and counts of c-Fos co-localized with \{CRF\} were made in the centrolateral and centromedial amygdala (CLA and CMA) as well as the dorsolateral (dl), dorsomedial (dm), and ventral (v) BNST. Ferret odor-exposed rats displayed an increase in duration and a decrease in latency of defensive burying versus control rats. Exposure to both predator stress and \{EPM\} induced neuronal activation in the BNST, but not the central amygdala, and similar levels of neuronal activation were seen in both the high and low anxiety groups in the \{BNST\} after \{EPM\} exposure. Dual-labeled immunohistochemistry showed a significant increase in the percentage of CRF/c-Fos co-localization in the vBNST of ferret odor-exposed rats compared to control and butyric acid-exposed groups as well as EPM-exposed rats compared to home cage controls. In addition, an increase in the percentage of CRF-containing neurons co-localized with c-Fos was observed in the dmBNST after \{EPM\} exposure. No changes in co-localization of \{CRF\} with c-Fos was observed with these treatments in either the \{CLA\} or CMA. These results suggest that predator odor and \{EPM\} exposure activates \{CRF\} neurons in the \{BNST\} to a much greater extent than \{CRF\} neurons of the central amygdala, and indicates unconditioned anxiogenic stimuli may activate unique anatomical circuits in the extended amygdala.

These neurons are important to chemoreception. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the chemically-coded \{RTN\} neurons (ccRTN) (Phox2b+/TH−) are activated during an acute episode of running exercise. Since most \{RTN\} neurons are excited by the activation of perifornical and lateral hypothalamus (PeF/LH), a region that regulates breathing during exercise, we also tested the hypothesis that PeF/LH projections to \{RTN\} neurons contribute to their activation during acute exercise. In adult male Wistar rats that underwent an acute episode of treadmill exercise, there was a significant increase in c-Fos immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir) in PeF/LH neurons and \{RTN\} neurons that were Phox2b+TH− (p &lt; 0.05) compared to rats that did not exercise. Also the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold that was injected into \{RTN\} was detected in c-Fos-ir PeF/LH (p &lt; 0.05). In summary, the ccRTN neurons (Phox2b+TH−) are excited by running exercise. Thus, ccRTN neurons may contribute to both the chemical drive to breath and the feed-forward control of breathing associated with exercise. "

One contributing factor in \{CIPN\} may be persistence of \{DNA\} lesions resulting from treatment with platinum-based agents such as cisplatin. In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of the base excision repair (BER) enzyme, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), reduces \{DNA\} damage and protects cultured sensory neurons treated with cisplatin. Here, we address stimulation of APE1’s endonuclease through a small molecule, nicorandil, as a means of mimicking the beneficial effects observed for overexpression of APE1. Nicorandil, was identified through high-throughput screening of small molecule libraries and found to stimulate \{APE1\} endonuclease activity by increasing catalytic efficiency approximately 2-fold. This stimulation is primarily due to an increase in kcat. To prevent metabolism of nicorandil, an approved drug in Europe for the treatment of angina, cultured sensory neurons were pretreated with nicorandil and daidzin, an aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 inhibitor, resulting in decreased \{DNA\} damage but not altered transmitter release by cisplatin. This finding suggests that activation of \{APE1\} by nicorandil in cisplatin-treated cultured sensory neurons does not imbalance the \{BER\} pathway in contrast to overexpression of the kinetically faster \{R177A\} APE1. Taken together, our results suggest that \{APE1\} activators can be used to reduce \{DNA\} damage induced by cisplatin in cultured sensory neurons, although further studies will be required to fully assess their protective effects.

In current clamp, warm- and cold-sensitive neurons were recorded in LPBel, \{LPBc\} and LPBd, the three \{LPB\} subnuclei responsible for the transmission of cutaneous feedforward signals. Of the 92 spontaneously firing \{LPB\} neurons, 27% were warm sensitive, 10% were cold sensitive, and 63% were temperature insensitive, and the spontaneous firing rate of the warm-sensitive neurons was significantly greater than that of the temperature-insensitive neurons. These proportions and spontaneous activity are similar to results obtained in the \{POA\} and spinal cord. Furthermore, the thermosensitivity was also present in 38% of silent neurons evoked by injection of a small amount of depolarizing current. Warm-sensitive neurons in the \{LPB\} were similar in thermoresponsiveness to those in the \{POA\} and spinal cord. However, cold sensitivity in the \{LPB\} was distinct from that in the POA. The firing rate of most cold-sensitive neurons changed steeply at a relatively narrow band of temperature, and some of them were silent near thermoneutrality. The percentages of thermosensitive and insensitive neurons within the three \{LPB\} subnuclei were not significantly different, nor were the mean maximal thermal coefficients of the thermosensitive neurons. These results suggest that \{LPB\} have local thermosensory functions as \{POA\} and spinal cord, and might be an important extrahypothalamic “thermoregulator”. "

Precise control over engrafted cell activity is highly desired, as cells do not always integrate properly into host circuitry and can cause suboptimal graft function or undesired outcomes. Here, we show tunable rescue of motor function in a mouse model of PD, following transplantation of human midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons differentiated from hPSCs engineered to express \{DREADDs\} (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug). Administering clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) enabled precise DREADD-dependent stimulation or inhibition of engrafted neurons, revealing \{D1\} receptor-dependent regulation of host neuronal circuitry by engrafted cells. Transplanted cells rescued motor defects, which could be reversed or enhanced by CNO-based control of graft function, and activating engrafted cells drives behavioral changes in transplanted mice. These results highlight the ability to exogenously and noninvasively control and refine therapeutic outcomes following cell transplantation. "

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with complex pathological mechanisms, including oxidative stress. Increasing evidence indicate that \{TCM\} has the potential to be neuroprotective drugs because of their antioxidant characteristics. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of LWDH-mediated protection in Parkinson's toxin-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration by evaluating water extract of \{LWDH\} (LWDH-WE) in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated primary mesencephalic neurons and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated C57BL/6 mice. In the present study, chemical profiling and quantitative analysis of LWDH-WE were revealed using 3D-HPLC technique, and were confirmed by the data of three batches of LWDH-WE. In primary mesencephalic neuronal cultures, LWDH-WE decreased MPP+-induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and increase of Annexin V-positive neurons. LWDH-WE reduced MPP+-induced oxidative damage via increasing antioxidant defense (SOD, GSH), decreasing \{ROS\} production, and down-regulating \{NADPH\} oxidases (Nox2 and Nox4). Also, LWDH-WE inhibited neuronal apoptosis by improving mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression, and down-regulating apoptotic signaling (Bax, cytochrome c, cleaved-caspase-3) in MPP+-treated neurons. In MPTP-treated C57BL/6 mice, LWDH-WE attenuated TH-positive neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and improved locomotor activity of mice. In conclusion, the present results reveal that LWDH-WE possesses protection on dopaminergic neurons through enhancing antioxidant defense and decreasing apoptotic death, suggesting the potential benefits of LWDH-WE for \{PD\} treatment.

When the \{DRG\} neuron is mechanically stimulated, an ionic current called a mechanosensitive current flows across its membrane. The kinetics of mechanosensitive currents are broadly classified into three types; rapidly adapting (RA), intermediately adapting, and slowly adapting. The kinetics of \{RA\} mechanosensitive currents are particularly intriguing. An \{RA\} mechanosensitive current is initially evoked by and rapidly adapts to a mechanical stimulus, but can also respond to an additional stimulus. Furthermore, an antecedent stimulus immediately followed by an additional stimulus suppresses reactivation of the current. The features of the kinetics depend on the characteristics of the mechanotransducer channels. Physiologists have proposed three factors associated with mechanotransducer channels, invoking activation, adaptation, and inactivation. In the present study, these factors are incorporated into an \{RA\} mechanosensitive current model. Computer simulations verified that the proposed model replicates the kinetics of real \{RA\} \{DRG\} mechanosensitive currents. The mechanosensitive current elicited by successive pulse-form stimuli was predominantly desensitized by the inactivating factor. Both the inactivating and adapting factors were involved in desensitization of a double-decker stimulus. The reduction of the sensitivity with decreasing velocity of the stimulus was mainly controlled by the adapting factor. "

Based on this, we conducted systematic screening to isolate genes regulated by Islet2a and affecting the development of axon growth in embryonic zebrafish sensory neurons. The 26 genes selected included some encoding factors involved in neuronal differentiation, axon growth, cellular signaling, and structural integrity of neurons, as well as genes whose functions are not fully determined. We chose four representative candidates as possible Islet2a downstream functional targets (simplet, tppp, tusc5 and tmem59l) and analyzed their respective mRNA expressions in dominant-negative Islet2a-expressing embryos.

Here, we report that Ctip1 controls precision of neocortical development by regulating subtype identity in deep-layer projection neurons. Ctip1 is expressed by postmitotic callosal and corticothalamic projection neurons but is excluded over embryonic development from corticospinal motor neurons, which instead express its close relative, Ctip2. Loss of Ctip1 function results in a striking bias in favor of subcerebral projection neuron development in sensory cortex at the expense of corticothalamic and deep-layer callosal development, while misexpression of Ctip1 in vivo represses subcerebral gene expression and projections. As we report in a paired paper, Ctip1 also controls acquisition of sensory area identity. Therefore, Ctip1 couples subtype and area specification, enabling specific functional areas to organize precise ratios of appropriate output projections. "

These progenitors express neither canonical neuroblast nor lamina precursor cell markers. They bifurcate into two sub-lineages in response to Notch signaling, generating lamina glia or Lawf neurons, respectively. The newly born glia and Lawfs then migrate tangentially over substantial distances to reach their target tissue.

The Notch receptor pathway has been implicated as a MeHg target in several studies. Notch signaling mediates cell–cell signals in a number of developmental contexts including neurogenesis and myogenesis, where it fundamentally acts to repress differentiation. Previous work in our lab has shown that MeHg causes preferential upregulation of a canonical Notch response gene, E(spl)mδ, in Drosophila embryos. In parallel, MeHg is seen to disrupt outgrowth of embryonic intersegmental motor nerves (ISN), which can be mimicked by expression of activated Notch in embryonic neurons. However, overexpression of E(spl)mδ in developing neurons fails to elicit motor neuron outgrowth defects, pointing to a non-autonomous role for E(spl)mδ in motor axon development. In this study we investigate a role for E(spl)mδ in conveying the toxicity of MeHg in the embryo. We find that endogenous expression of the E(spl)mδ gene localizes to developing somatic muscles in embryos. Notably, E(spl)mδ expression is seen in several muscles that are known synaptic targets for both the \{ISN\} and the segmental motor nerve (SN). We also demonstrate that the SN, similar to the ISN, exhibits disrupted axon outgrowth in response to MeHg. E(spl)mδ can induce a \{SN\} motor neuron phenotype, similar to MeHg treatment; but, only when E(spl)mδ expression is targeted to developing muscles. E(spl)mδ overexpression in developing muscles also results in aberrant muscle morphology, which is not apparent with expression of the closely related E(spl)mγ in developing muscles. Our data point to a role for the Notch target E(spl)mδ in mediating MeHg toxicity in embryonic development by disrupting the coordinated targeting of motor neurons to their muscle targets. "

The ability of proteasome inhibitors to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis has emerged as a powerful strategy for cancer therapy. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used as an antineoplastic drug, although its neurotoxicity frequently causes a severe sensory peripheral neuropathy. In this study we used a rat model of bortezomib treatment to study the nucleolar and Cajal body responses to the proteasome inhibition in sensory ganglion neurons that are major targets of bortezomib-induced neurotoxicity. Treatment with bortezomib induced dose-dependent dissociation of protein synthesis machinery (chromatolysis) and nuclear retention of poly(A) \{RNA\} granules resulting in neuronal dysfunction. However, as a compensatory response to the proteotoxic stress, both nucleoli and Cajal bodies exhibited reactive changes. These include an increase in the number and size of nucleoli, strong nucleolar incorporation of the \{RNA\} precursor 5′-fluorouridine, and increased expression of both 45S rRNA and genes encoding nucleolar proteins UBF, fibrillarin and B23. Taken together, these findings appear to reflect the activation of the nucleolar transcription in response to proteotoxic stress Furthermore, the number of Cajal bodies, a parameter related to transcriptional activity, increases upon proteasome inhibition. We propose that nucleoli and Cajal bodies are important targets in the signaling pathways that are activated by the proteotoxic stress response to proteasome inhibition. The coordinating activity of these two organelles in the production of snRNA, snoRNA and rRNA may contribute to neuronal survival after proteasome inhibition.

However, its clinical usage is particularly limited. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), which acts as a selective agonist of \{BDNF\} receptor TrkB, is reported to possess neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo. Here we explored the potent neuroprotective effects of 7,8-DHF in 6-OHDA induced rat and \{MPTP\} induced mouse model of Parkinsonism. The results demonstrated that treatment with 7,8-DHF in drinking water for four weeks (two weeks before 6-OHDA + two weeks after 6-OHDA lesion) significantly improved dopamine-mediated behaviors in 6-OHDA rat model, and prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Phospho-Y816-TrkB immunostaining showed that TrkB phosphorylation was significantly elevated in the \{SN\} in 7,8-DHF pretreated group, indicating 7,8-DHF activated TrkB and likely contributed to its neuroprotective effects. 7,8-DHF also protected acute \{MPTP\} neurotoxicity in mice but did not affect the climbing behavior in pole test. Thus our study indicates the neuroprotective properties of 7,8-DHF through the activation of TrkB, which provides a novel therapeutic treatment for Parkinson’s disease. "

However, little is understood about the mechanism underlying \{CGA\} analgesia. Here, we have found that \{CGA\} can exert an inhibitory effect on the functional activity of native acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. First, \{CGA\} decreased the peak amplitude of proton-gated currents mediated by \{ASICs\} in a concentration-dependent manner. Second, \{CGA\} shifted the proton concentration–response curve downward, with a decrease of 41.76 ± 8.65% in the maximum current response to protons but with no significant change in the pH0.5 value. Third, \{CGA\} altered acidosis-evoked membrane excitability of rat \{DRG\} neurons and caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of the depolarization and the number of action potentials induced by acid stimuli. Finally, peripheral administered \{CGA\} attenuated nociceptive response to intraplantar injection of acetic acid in rats. \{ASICs\} are distributed in peripheral sensory neurons and participate in nociception. Our findings \{CGA\} inhibition of native \{ASICs\} indicated that \{CGA\} may exert analgesic action by modulating \{ASICs\} in the primary afferent neurons, which revealed a novel cellular and molecular mechanism underlying \{CGA\} analgesia "

Here, we demonstrate that \{SMN\} protein is significantly reduced in the spinal cords of patients with sporadic ALS. To test the potential of \{SMN\} as a modifier of ALS, we overexpressed \{SMN\} in 2 different strains of \{SOD1G93A\} mice. Neuronal overexpression of \{SMN\} significantly preserved locomotor function, rescued motor neurons, and attenuated astrogliosis in spinal cords of \{SOD1G93A\} mice. Despite this, survival was not prolonged, most likely resulting from \{SMN\} mislocalization and depletion of gems in motor neurons of symptomatic mice. Our results reveal that \{SMN\} upregulation slows locomotor deficit onset and motor neuron loss in this mouse model of ALS. However, disruption of \{SMN\} nuclear complexes by high levels of mutant SOD1, even in the presence of \{SMN\} overexpression, might limit its survival promoting effects in this specific mouse model. Studies in emerging mouse models of \{ALS\} are therefore warranted to further explore the potential of \{SMN\} as a modifier of ALS. "

Recent reports indicate that oxidative stress through \{NADPH\} oxidase activates \{TRPM2\} channels. \{HP\} may be a useful treatment for Ca2+ entry and oxidative stress through modulation of \{TRPM2\} channels in the DRG. We aimed to investigate the protective role of \{HP\} on Ca2+ entry and oxidative stress through \{TRPM2\} channels in \{DRG\} neurons of rats. The native rat \{DRG\} neurons were used in whole-cell patch-clamp, Fura-2 and antioxidant experiments. Appropriate, nontoxic concentrations and incubation times for \{HP\} were determined in the \{DRG\} neurons by assessing cell viability. The H2O2-induced \{TRPM2\} currents were inhibited by 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) and N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA). \{TRPM2\} current densities and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in the neurons were also reduced by \{HP\} (2 and 24 h). In Fura-2 experiments, cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization was reduced by voltage-gated calcium channel blockers (verapamil + diltiazem, V + D) and HP. Glutathione peroxidase activity and \{GSH\} values in the \{DRG\} were high in HP, 2-APB and V + D groups although lipid peroxidation level was low in the groups. In conclusion, we observed a protective role for \{HP\} on Ca2+ entry through a \{TRPM2\} channel in the \{DRG\} neurons. Since over-production of oxidative stress and Ca2+ entry are implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain and neuronal inflammation, our findings may be relevant to the etiology and treatment of neuropathology in \{DRG\} neurons.

The vomeronasal organ (VNO), part of the accessory olfactory system mediates many of these chemically driven behaviors. The \{VNO\} is heavily vascularized, and is readily accessible to circulating peptide or steroid hormones. Potentially, this allows circulating hormones to alter behavior through modulating the output of the primary sensory neurons in the VNO, the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). Based on this, we hypothesized that steroid hormones, in particular 17β-estradiol, would modulate activity of VSNs. In this paper, we show that the estrogen receptors, \{GPR30\} and ERα, were present in \{VSNs\} and that estradiol may be synthesized locally in the VNO. Our results also showed that 17β-estradiol decreased responses of isolated \{VSNs\} to dilute urine, a potent natural stimulus, with respect to current amplitudes and depolarization. Further, 17β-estradiol increased the latency of the first action potential (AP) and the \{AP\} amplitude. Additionally, calcium responses to sulfated steroids (present in the low molecular weight fraction of urine) that act as ligands for apical vomeronasal receptors were decreased by 17β-estradiol. In conclusion, we show that estradiol modulates odorant responses mediated by \{VSNs\} and hence paves the way for future studies to better understand the mechanisms by which odorant mediated behavior is altered by endocrine status of the animal.

To fully understand the underlying mechanism, standard electrophysiology was performed with trigeminal ganglion neurons (TGNs) isolated from adult rats of both genders using the whole-cell patch clamp technique to test the distribution, neuroexcitability, and chemosensitivity to histamine. In addition to traditionally classified A- and C-type TGNs, myelinated Ah-type \{TGNs\} were also observed in females. The electrophysiological features showed low firing threshold and the capability to fire repetitively upon stimulation. Ah-type neurons also functionally expressed persistent TTX-R Na+ channels with more hyperpolarized activating voltage. Iberiotoxin and \{NS11021\} significantly altered the discharge profiles of Ah-type TGNs. Finally, Ah-type \{TGNs\} showed a more potent reaction to histamine, with relatively larger inward currents and membrane depolarization compared with C-types. These data provide evidence of the gender-specific distribution of myelinated Ah-type \{TGNs\} in adult female rats, characterized by a low threshold and high frequency of firing that are at least partially attributable to persistent TTX-R Na+ and BK-KCa channel expression and potent chemosensitivity to histamine, suggesting that Ah-type \{TGNs\} may play a key role in gender differences in migraine.

Moreover, high levels of oscillatory activity and synchronization have also been described in both intra- and inter-basal ganglia nuclei and the cerebral cortex. However, the relevance of these alterations in the motor symptomatology related to Parkinsonism and \{LID\} is not fully understood. Recently, we have shown that subthalamic neuronal activity correlates with axial abnormal movements and that a subthalamic nucleus (STN) lesion partially reduces \{LID\} severity as well as the expression of some striatal molecular modifications. The aim of the present study was to assess, through single-unit extracellular recording techniques under urethane anaesthesia, neuronal activity of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and its relationship with \{LID\} and \{STN\} hyperactivity together with oscillatory and synchronization between these nuclei and the cerebral cortex in 6-OHDA-lesioned and dyskinetic rats. Twenty-four hours after the last injection of L-DOPA the firing rate and the inhibitory response to an acute challenge of L-DOPA of \{SNr\} neurons from dyskinetic animals were increased with respect to those found in intact and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the mean firing rate of \{SNr\} neurons and the severity of the abnormal movements (limb and orolingual subtypes). There was also a significant correlation between the firing activity of \{SNr\} and \{STN\} neurons recorded from dyskinetic rats. In addition, low frequency band oscillatory activity and synchronization both within the \{SNr\} or \{STN\} and with the cerebral cortex were enhanced in 6-OHDA-lesioned animals and not or slightly affected by chronic treatment with L-DOPA. Altogether, these results indicate that neuronal \{SNr\} firing activity is relevant in dyskinesia and may be driven by \{STN\} hyperactivity. Conversely, low frequency oscillatory activity and synchronization seem to be more important in \{PD\} because they are not influenced by prolonged L-DOPA administration. "

Our lab recently demonstrated a role for the \{GABAAR\} δ subunit in the tonic \{GABAergic\} regulation of \{CRH\} neurons. Using a floxed Gabrd mouse model established in our laboratory, we generated mice in which the \{GABAAR\} δ subunit is selectively removed from \{CRH\} neurons (Gabrd/Crh mice), resulting in a loss of tonic \{GABAergic\} inhibition in these neurons. Interestingly, the loss of this tonic \{GABAergic\} constraint did not significantly alter basal levels of corticosterone (CORT). However, the loss of the \{GABAAR\} δ subunit in \{CRH\} neurons blunted the \{CORT\} response to stress, likely due to the loss of the disinhibitory effect of \{GABA\} following acute stress. This blunting of \{HPA\} axis reactivity was associated with a decrease in depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors. Exogenous \{CORT\} was sufficient to increase anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in Gabrd/Crh mice. Together, these results show the importance of the \{GABAAR\} δ subunit in the regulation of \{CRH\} neurons, and thus the \{HPA\} axis, and demonstrate that dysregulation of \{CRH\} neurons alters stress-related behaviors.

While Rho kinase inhibition enhanced recovery of motor function after trauma, there were no substantial increases in the recruitment of DCX+ neuroblasts or the number of BrdU+ or EdU+ labelled newborn neurons in the pericontusional cortex of Y27632-treated mice. Inhibition of Rho kinase significantly reduced the number of degenerating cortical neurons at 1 day post-injury compared to saline controls but had no longer term effect on neuronal degeneration, with only modest effects on astrocytic reactivity and macrophage/microglial responses. Overall, this study showed that Rho kinase contributes to acute neurodegenerative processes in the injured cortex but does not play a significant role in \{SVZ\} neural precursor cell-derived adult neurogenesis, glial responses or blood–brain barrier permeability following a moderately severe brain injury.

It is shown that in specific neuron models the spatiotemporal variations of the membrane's voltage follow partial differential equations (PDEs) of the wave type while in other models such variations are associated with the propagation of solitary waves in the membrane. To compute the dynamics of the membrane \{PDE\} model without knowledge of initial conditions and through the processing of noisy measurements, a new filtering method, under the name Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filtering, is proposed. The \{PDE\} of the membrane is decomposed into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with respect to time. Next, each one of the local models associated with the ordinary differential equations is transformed into a model of the linear canonical (Brunovsky) form through a change of coordinates (diffeomorphism) which is based on differential flatness theory. This transformation provides an extended model of the nonlinear dynamics of the membrane for which state estimation is possible by applying the standard Kalman Filter recursion. The proposed filtering method is tested through numerical simulation tests. "

The conditional ADAR2-knockout mice were divided into 3 groups by stage: presymptomatic (AR2H mice), early symptomatic (AR2 mice, \{AR2H\} mice) and late symptomatic (AR2Slow mice). Light-microscopically, some motor neurons in \{AR2\} and \{AR2H\} mice (presymptomatic) showed simple neuronal atrophy and astrogliosis, and \{AR2H\} (early symptomatic) and \{AR2Slow\} mice often showed vacuoles predominantly in motor neurons. The number of vacuole-bearing anterior horn neurons decreased with the loss of anterior horn neurons in \{AR2H\} mice after 40 weeks of age. Electron-microscopically, in \{AR2\} mice, while the cytoplasm of normal-looking motor neurons was almost always normal-appearing, the interior of dendrites was frequently loose and disorganized. In \{AR2H\} and \{AR2Slow\} mice, large vacuoles without a limiting membrane were observed in the anterior horns, preferentially in the nuclei of motor neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Nuclear vacuoles were not observed in \{AR2res\} (ADAR2flox/flox/VAChT-Cre.Fast/GluR-BR/R) mice, in which motor neurons express edited GluA2 in the absence of ADAR2. These findings suggest that ADAR2-reduction is associated with progressive deterioration of nuclear architecture, resulting in vacuolated nuclei due to a Ca2+-permeable \{AMPA\} receptor-mediated mechanism.

abstract = "Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons may be effectively used for drug discovery and cell-based therapy. However, the immaturity of cultured human iPSC-derived neurons and the lack of established functional evaluation methods are problematic. We here used a multi-electrode array (MEA) system to investigate the effects of the co-culture of rat astrocytes with hiPSC-derived neurons on the long-term culture, spontaneous firing activity, and drug responsiveness effects. The co-culture facilitated the long-term culture of hiPSC-derived neurons for &gt;3 months and long-term spontaneous firing activity was also observed. After &gt;3 months of culture, we observed synchronous burst firing activity due to synapse transmission within neuronal networks. Compared with rat neurons, hiPSC-derived neurons required longer time to mature functionally. Furthermore, addition of the synapse antagonists bicuculline and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione induced significant changes in the firing rate. In conclusion, we used a \{MEA\} system to demonstrate that the co-culture of hiPSC-derived neurons with rat astrocytes is an effective method for studying the function of human neuronal cells, which could be used for drug screening.

These changes are generally characterized by atrophy (e.g., a decrease in volume and number of synaptic contacts). Recent studies have reported age-related spatial memory deficits in older pigeons similar to those seen in older mammals. However, to date, little is known about any co-occurring changes in the aging avian hippocampal formation (HF). In the current study, it was found that the \{HF\} of older pigeons was actually larger and contained more neurons than the \{HF\} of younger pigeons, a finding that suggests that the pattern of structural changes during aging in the avian \{HF\} is different from that seen in the mammalian hippocampus. A working hypothesis for relating the observed structural changes with spatial-cognitive decline is offered. "

Furthermore, the quantification of degeneracy has not been addressed for realistic neuronal networks. The objective of this paper is to characterize degeneracy in neuronal network models via quantitative mathematic measures. Firstly, we establish Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks with Newman–Watts small world network architectures. Secondly, in order to calculate the degeneracy, redundancy and complexity in the ensuing networks, we use information entropy to quantify the information a neuronal response carries about the stimulus – and mutual information to measure the contribution of each subset of the neuronal network. Finally, we analyze the interdependency of degeneracy, redundancy and complexity – and how these three measures depend upon network architectures. Our results suggest that degeneracy can be applied to any neuronal network as a formal measure, and degeneracy is distinct from redundancy. Qualitatively degeneracy and complexity are more highly correlated over different network architectures, in comparison to redundancy. Quantitatively, the relationship between both degeneracy and redundancy depends on network coupling strength: both degeneracy and redundancy increase with complexity for small coupling strengths; however, as coupling strength increases, redundancy decreases with complexity (in contrast to degeneracy, which is relatively invariant). These results suggest that the degeneracy is a general topologic characteristic of neuronal networks, which could be applied quantitatively in neuroscience and connectomics. "

L-β-ODAP caused a prolonged rise of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in rat spinal cord MNs, and the [Ca2+]i accumulation was inversely proportional to the MN’s life span. The [Ca2+]i rise induced by L-β-ODAP or (S)-AMPA was antagonized completely by NBQX, an AMPA-receptor blocker. However, blocking the L-type Ca2+ channel with nifedipine significantly lowered [Ca2+]i induced by (S)-AMPA, but not that by L-β-ODAP. Tetrodotoxin completely extinguished the [Ca2+]i rise induced by (S)-AMPA or kainic acid, whereas that induced by L-β-ODAP was only attenuated by 65.6 ± 6% indicating the prominent involvement of voltage-independent Ca2+ entry. The tetrodotoxin-resistant [Ca2+]i induced by L-β-ODAP was blocked by 2-APB, Gd3+, La3+, 1-(β-[3-(4-methoxy-phenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SKF-96365) and flufenamic acid, which all are blockers of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Blockers of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR I), 7-(hydroxyiminocyclopropan[b]chromen-1α-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCPEt) and 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) also lowered the [Ca2+]i rise by L-β-ODAP. \{MN\} cell death induced by L-β-ODAP was prolonged significantly with SKF-96365 as well as NBQX.

Classical antipsychotic drugs modulate information processing in cortico-limbic circuits via dopamine \{D2\} receptor blockade in nucleus accumbens (NAc) whereas atypical antipsychotic drugs preferentially target cortical serotonin (5-HT) receptors. The brain networks involved in the therapeutic action of atypical drugs are not fully understood. Previous work indicated that medial \{PFC\} (mPFC) pyramidal neurons projecting to ventral tegmental area express 5-HT2A receptors suggesting that atypical antipsychotic drugs modulate dopaminergic activity distally, via 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2A-R) blockade in PFC. Since the mPFC also projects heavily to NAc, we examined whether NAc-projecting pyramidal neurons also express 5-HT2A-R. Using a combination of retrograde tracing experiments and in situ hybridization we report that a substantial proportion of mPFC-NAc pyramidal neurons in rat brain express 5-HT2A-R mRNA in a layer- and area-specific manner (up to 68% in layer V of contralateral cingulate). The functional relevance of 5-HT2A-R to modulate mPFC-NAc projections was examined in dual-probe microdialysis experiments. The application of the preferential 5-HT2A-R agonist \{DOI\} into mPFC enhanced glutamate release locally (+66 ± 18%) and in \{NAc\} (+74 ± 12%) indicating that cortical 5-HT2A-R activation augments glutamatergic transmission in NAc. Since \{NAc\} integrates glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs, blockade of 5-HT2A-R by atypical drugs may reduce cortical excitatory inputs onto \{GABAergic\} neurons of NAc, adding to dopamine \{D2\} receptor blockade. Together with previous observations, the present results suggest that atypical antipsychotic drugs may control the activity of the mesolimbic pathway at cell body and terminal level. "

Injection of GLS-shRNA lentiviral vector into bilateral cerebellar \{IN\} downregulated \{GLS\} expression in the IN. The silencing of \{GLS\} gene in the cerebellar \{IN\} decreased interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-γ production, B-cell number, and IgM antibody level in response to antigen bovine serum albumin (BSA). On the contrary, injection of \{GLS\} lentiviral vector into bilateral cerebellar \{IN\} upregulated \{GLS\} expression in the IN. The \{GLS\} gene overexpression in the \{IN\} caused opposite immune effects to the \{GLS\} gene knockdown. Simultaneously, the \{GLS\} gene silencing in the cerebellar \{IN\} reduced and the \{GLS\} overexpression elevated glutamate content in the hypothalamus, but they both did not affect glycine and \{GABA\} contents in the hypothalamus. In addition, the immune changes caused by the \{GLS\} gene interventions in the \{IN\} were accompanied by alteration in norepinephrine content in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes but not by changes in adrenocortical and thyroid hormone levels in serum. These findings indicate that glutamatergic neurons in the cerebellar \{IN\} regulate cellular and humoral immune responses and suggest that such immunoregulation may be conveyed by cerebellar IN-hypothalamic glutamatergic projections and sympathetic nerves that innervate lymphoid tissues.

The present study aimed to evaluate in the hippocampus of C57Bl/6 mice fed a standard (SD) or a 60% fructose (HFRT) diet for 12 weeks the production of the most studied AGEs, carboxy methyllysine (CML), focusing on the role of the glutathione-dependent enzyme glyoxalase (Glo-1), the main AGEs-detoxifying system, in relation to early signs of neuronal impairment. \{HFRT\} diet evoked \{CML\} accumulation in the cell body of pyramidal neurons, followed by RAGE/NFkB signaling activation. A widespread reactive gliosis and altered mitochondrial respiratory complexes activity have been evidenced in \{HFRT\} hippocampi, paralleled by oxidative stress increase due to impaired activity of Nrf2 signaling. In addition, a translocation of Glo-1 from axons toward cell body of pyramidal neurons has been observed in \{HFRT\} mice, in relation to \{CML\} accumulation. Despite increased expression of dimeric Glo-1, its enzymatic activity was not upregulated in \{HFRT\} hippocampi, due to reduced glutathione availability, thus failing to prevent \{CML\} accumulation. The prevention of \{CML\} production by administration of the specific inhibitor pyridoxamine was able to prevent all the fructose-induced hippocampal alterations. In conclusion, a high-fructose consumption, through \{CML\} accumulation and Glo-1 impairment, induces in the hippocampus the same molecular and metabolic alterations observed in early phases of neurodegenerative diseases, and can thus represent a risk factor for their onset.

Caudal- and rostral-ventrolateral medullary regions (CVLM and RVLM, respectively) of the brainstem are key nuclei involved in all aspects of the cardiovascular system. In this study, we investigate a novel role for microglia in cardiovascular control in the brainstem of adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat. Here we show, that increases and decreases in blood pressure (BP) triggers alertness in the physiology of microglia in the brainstem region; inducing changes in microglial spatial distribution and the number of synapses in contact with microglial end processes. Following 6 h of acute hypertension, the number of synapses in contact with microglia increased by ≈30% in both regions of the brainstem, \{CVLM\} and RVLM. Induction of acute hypotension for 6 h causes microglia to reduce the number of synaptic contacts by &gt;20% in both, \{CVLM\} and RVLM, nuclei of the brainstem. Our analysis of the morphological characteristics of microglia, and expression levels of \{M1\} and M2, reveals that the changes induced in microglial behavior do not require any obvious dramatic changes in their morphology. Taken together, our findings suggest that microglia play a novel, unexpected, physiological role in the uninjured autonomic nuclei of CNS; we therefore speculate that microglia act cooperatively with brainstem cardiovascular neurons to maintain them in a physiologically receptive state.

An important pathophysiological aspect is the loss of balance between striatopallidal and striatonigral pathways. Nur77 is an orphan nuclear receptor and dopamine-regulated immediate-early gene. Classical antipsychotic drugs widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia, such as haloperidol, increase Nur77 mRNA expression in the striatum. However, little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways involved in Nur77 induction. Here, using pharmacological approaches and transgenic mutant mice, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the up-regulation of Nur77 protein expression in the dorsal striatum after haloperidol injection. In drd1a::EGFP transgenic mice that express \{GFP\} in \{D1\} neurons, Nur77 up-regulation induced by haloperidol occurred predominantly in GFP-negative neurons. In Gαolf heterozygous mutant mice, in which cAMP production in response to \{A2A\} stimulation is impaired in the striatum, haloperidol effect was not altered. In contrast, in DARPP-32 knock-in mutant mice bearing a \{T34A\} point mutation of the site responsible for cAMP-dependent phosphatase 1 inhibition, Nur77 up-regulation by haloperidol was prevented. Haloperidol also induced Nur77 protein in \{D2\} neurons of the nucleus accumbens core of wild type but not \{T34A\} knock-in mice. Thus, our results show that expression of Nur77 is induced by haloperidol in \{D2\} receptors-expressing medium-sized spiny neurons, through cAMP-dependent regulation of protein phosphatase 1, which is likely to modulate the effects of other protein kinases. Our results clarify the mechanisms of Nur77 induction by antipsychotic and its possible contribution to extrapyramidal effects. "

Moreover, we find that the response can be strongly improved if the level of nonidentical signal phases is at an intermediate value and thus resulting in a resonance-like phenomenon. Furthermore, under the influence of nonidentical signal phases, the response also exhibits a resonance-like dependency on the coupling coefficient. Moreover, we give an analysis to understand the mechanism of these two types of resonance behaviors. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the resonances induced by nonidentical signal phases to neuronal diversity, noise perturbation and different neuron model. We believe that the phenomena found in this paper will be useful for understanding neural information processing. "

The present study investigated whether modulation of voltage-gated potassium (K) channels by \{BDNF\} contributes to this hyperexcitability effect. To induce inflammation we injected complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the MM. The escape threshold from mechanical stimulation applied to skin above the inflamed \{MM\} was significantly lower than in naïve rats. \{TRG\} neurons innervating the site of inflammation were subsequently identified by fluorogold (FG) labeling, and microbeads (MB) were used to label neurons projecting specifically to the Vi/Vc region. \{BDNF\} significantly decreased the total, transient (IA), and sustained (IK) currents in FG-/MB-labeled small-diameter \{TRG\} neurons under voltage-clamp conditions in naïve and inflamed rats. The magnitude of inhibition of \{IA\} and \{IK\} currents by \{BDNF\} in FG-/MB-labeled \{TRG\} neurons was significantly greater in inflamed rats than in naïve rats, and \{BDNF\} inhibited \{IA\} to a significantly greater extent than IK. Furthermore, co-administration of K252a, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abolished the suppression of \{IA\} and \{IK\} currents by BDNF. These results suggested that the inhibitory effects of \{BDNF\} on \{IA\} and \{IK\} currents in small-diameter \{TRG\} neurons projecting onto the Vi/Vc potentiate neuronal excitability, and in turn, contribute to \{MM\} inflammatory hyperalgesia. These findings support the development of voltage-gated K+ channel openers and tyrosine kinase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of trigeminal inflammatory hyperalgesia. "

abstract = "AbstractBackground The vector for neuron-specific retrograde gene transfer (NeuRet) is a pseudotype of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-based vector with fusion glycoprotein type C (FuG-C), which consists of the N-terminal region of the extracellular domain of rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) and the membrane-proximal region of the extracellular domain and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). The NeuRet vector shows a high efficiency of gene transfer through retrograde axonal transport and transduces selectively neuronal cells around the injection site. New method We aimed to improve the efficiency of retrograde gene transfer of the NeuRet vector by optimizing the junction of \{RVG\} and \{VSVG\} segments in fusion glycoproteins in their membrane-proximal region. Results We produced various types of fusion glycoproteins, in which the junction of the two glycoprotein segments diverged in the membrane-proximal region and used for pseudotyping of HIV-1-based vector to evaluate the in vivo gene transfer efficiency after intrastriatal injection. We found a novel type of fusion glycoprotein termed type E (FuG-E) that yielded enhanced efficiency of retrograde gene delivery, showing neuron-specific transduction surrounding the injection site. Comparison with existing methods The NeuRet vector pseudotyped with FuG-E displayed the improved efficiency of retrograde gene transfer into different neural pathways compared with the original vector pseudotyped with FuG-C. Conclusions Our vector system with FuG-E provides a powerful tool for gene therapeutic trials of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and for the study of the mechanisms of neural networks underlying various brain functions.

Not only do they give neurons their unique appearance, but dendrites also endow neurons with the ability to receive and transform synaptic inputs. We now have a wealth of information about the functioning of dendrites which suggests that the integration of synaptic inputs is highly dependent on both dendritic properties and neuronal input patterns. It has been shown that dendrites can perform non-linear processing, actively transforming synaptic input into Na+ spikes, Ca2+ plateau spikes and \{NMDA\} spikes. These membrane non-linearities can have a large impact on the neuronal output and have been shown to be regulated by numerous factors including synaptic inhibition. Many neuropathological diseases involve changes in how dendrites receive and package synaptic input by altering dendritic spine characteristics, ion channel expression and the inhibitory control of dendrites. This review focuses on the role of dendrites in integrating and transforming input and what goes wrong in the case of neuropathological diseases.

Little is known, however, about the neurochemical sensitivity of neurons located in this area. Substantial evidence indicates that the locus ceruleus – noradrenaline (NA) projection system and the nucleus basalis magnocellularis – cholinergic projection system regulate behavioral state and state dependent processing of sensory information, various cognitive functions already associated with the mdPFC. The main goal of the present study was to examine noradrenergic and cholinergic responsiveness of glucose-monitoring and glucose-insensitive (GIS) neurons in the mediodorsal prefrontal cortex. One fifth of the neurons tested changed in firing rate to microelectrophoretically applied NA. Responsiveness of the \{GM\} cells to this catecholamine proved to be significantly higher than that of the \{GIS\} units. Microiontophoretic application of acetylcholine (Ach) resulted in activity changes (predominantly facilitation) of more than 40% of the mdPFC neurons. Proportion of Ach sensitive units among the \{GM\} and the \{GIS\} neurons was found to be similar. The glucose-monitoring neurons of the mdPFC and their distinct \{NA\} and remarkable Ach sensitivity are suggested to be of particular significance in prefrontal control of adaptive behaviors. "

Although several factors for the neuronal loss have been suggested, most of the \{PD\} cases are sporadic and idiopathic. In our previous study, we demonstrated the first evidence that solely chronic restraint stress (RS) induced the \{DA\} neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SN). In this study, we further investigated whether chronic stress could affect other major \{DA\} systems, \{VTA\} and tuberoinfundibular system (TIDA), by using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization techniques. The present study showed that, in the VTA, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactive neurons decreased by 9.8% at 2nd week, 19.2% at 4th week, 39.5% at 8th week, and 40.6% at 16th week during chronic \{RS\} as compared to control. Similarly, in the TIDA, the \{TH\} neurons decreased by 10.9% at 2nd week, 38.2% at 4th week, 56.3% at 8th week, and 57.1% at 16th week. The in situ hybridization results consistently demonstrated decreases in Th mRNA expressing cells in the \{VTA\} and \{TIDA\} in a comparable time dependent manner. These findings suggest that exposure to chronic stress may simultaneously induce multiple neuronal loss of \{DA\} systems. This finding may be helpful to understand the psycho-neurological symptoms of sporadic type of PD. "

Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), pH sensors, are distributed in peripheral sensory neurons and participate in nociception. Morphine exerts potent analgesic effects through the activation of opioid receptors for various pain conditions. A cross-talk between \{ASICs\} and opioid receptors in peripheral sensory neurons has not been shown so far. Here, we have found that morphine inhibits the activity of native \{ASICs\} in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Morphine dose-dependently inhibited proton-gated currents mediated by \{ASICs\} in the presence of the \{TRPV1\} inhibitor capsazepine. Morphine shifted the proton concentration–response curve downwards, with a decrease of 51.4±3.8% in the maximum current response but with no significant change in the pH0.5 value. Another μ-opioid receptor agonist \{DAMGO\} induced a similar decrease in \{ASIC\} currents compared with morphine. The morphine inhibition of \{ASIC\} currents was blocked by naloxone, a specific opioid receptor antagonist. Pretreatment of forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, or the addition of cAMP reversed the inhibitory effect of morphine. Moreover, morphine altered acid-evoked excitability of rat \{DRG\} neurons and decreased the number of action potentials induced by acid stimuli. Finally, peripheral applied morphine relieved pain evoked by intraplantar of acetic acid in rats. Our results indicate that morphine can inhibit the activity of \{ASICs\} via μ-opioid receptor and cAMP dependent signal pathway. These observations demonstrate a cross-talk between \{ASICs\} and opioid receptors in peripheral sensory neurons, which was a novel analgesic mechanism of morphine. "

Results The culture contained 15% neurons and 85% non-neuronal cells. A cytopathic effect was observed, associated with high viral spread (72.9% neurons and 48.3% non-neuronal cells were positive for viral antigen). Interferon-β treatment impaired the cytopathic effect and decreased the infected neurons to 16.7% and infected non-neuronal cells to 7.8%. Viral infection at 6 h post-infection significantly increased the interferon-β transcripts by 18.2 fold, while at 18 h post-infection Interferon pre-treatment in infected cultures increased interferon-β transcription by 3.7 fold. Discussion This culture model contained 15% neurons, which is 10 times higher compared to other reported cultures, and non-neuronal cells comprised 85% of cells in this culture. All types of cells were found to be infected, which is similar to that reported during acute infections in vivo. Additionally, interferon-β decreased the infected cells, avoiding the cytopathic effect, which is similar to that reported in swine \{TG\} cultures. Conclusions A neuron-enriched primary \{TG\} model was characterized. Interferon-β treatment protected cells from cytopathic effects and viral spread, while viral infection up-regulated interferon-β expression. This result means that interferon-β exerts an important antiviral effect against HSV-1 in these cultures. "

As an important mediator for the non-genomic functions of estrogen, \{GPER1\} (G Protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor 1) has been suggested to involve in the beneficial roles of estrogen in neural cells. Here our studies on primary hippocampal neurons have focused on \{GPER1\} in an in vitro model of ischemia using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). \{GPER1\} expression in the primary hippocampal neurons was stimulated by the \{OGD\} treatments. Both \{E2\} (estradiol) and E2-BSA (membrane impermeable estradiol by covalent conjugation of bovine serum albumin) attenuated OGD-induced cell death in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Importantly, this membrane-mediated estrogen function requires \{GPER1\} protein. Knocking down of \{GPER1\} diminished, while overexpression of \{GPER1\} potentiated, the protective roles of E2/E2-BSA following OGD. Additionally, the downstream mechanisms employed by membrane-associated estrogen signaling were found to include PI3K/Akt-dependent Ask1 inhibition in the primary hippocampal neurons. Overall, these research results could enhance our understanding of the neuroprotective actions for estrogen, and provide a new therapeutic target for improving stroke outcome and ameliorating degenerative neurological diseases.

We found that exposure to excess NaCl, 10–100 mmol/L, for 20 h caused cell death in cultured cerebellar granule cells (neurons). Toxicity was due to Na+, since substituting excess Na+ with choline reduced cell death to control levels, whereas gluconate instead of excess Cl− did not. Prior to cell death from hyperosmolar NaCl, glucose consumption and lactate formation were reduced, and intracellular aspartate levels were elevated, consistent with reduced glycolysis or glucose uptake. Concomitantly, the level of \{ATP\} became reduced. Pyruvate, 10 mmol/L, reduced NaCl-induced cell death. The extracellular levels of glutamate, taurine, and \{GABA\} were concentration-dependently reduced by excess NaCl; high-affinity glutamate uptake increased. High extracellular [Na+] caused reduction in intracellular free [Ca2+], but a similar effect was seen with mannitol, which was not neurotoxic. We suggest that inhibition of glucose metabolism with ensuing loss of \{ATP\} is a neurotoxic mechanism of hyperosmolar sodium, whereas increased uptake of extracellular neuroactive amino acids and reduced intracellular [Ca2+] may, if they occur in vivo, contribute to the cerebral dysfunction and delirium described in hypernatremia.

The results show that: (1) in the presence of voltage- and ATP-gated K+ channel blockers application of 5.0 μM Aβ31–35 significantly diminished transient outward K+ current amplitudes at clamped voltages between 0 and 45 mV; (2) under the same conditions [Ca2+]i was minimally affected by 5.0 μM but significantly increased by 12.5 μM and 25 μM Aβ31–35; and (3) when 25 μM of a larger fragment of the amyloid β-peptide, Aβ25–35, was applied, the results were similar to those obtained with the same concentration of Aβ31–35.

Lower motor neuron lesions are defined as damage to the second-order motor neuron, which includes the cell body (known as perikaryon or anterior horn cell of the spinal cord) and exiting motor axon. Because cranial nerve nuclei lie in the intracranial cavity, they exit the calvarium as lower motor neurons. Lesions of the lower motor neuron differ from those of the upper motor neuron in the loss of tone, deep tendon reflexes, and muscle atrophy. The pattern of muscle weakness resulting from damage to a particular nerve or neuron can be used to assist in the identification of the specific abnormality or disease process. Demyelinating nerve lesions can have clinical findings similar to lower motor neuronal lesions. Nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography are important tools in the accurate diagnosis of abnormalities or disease processes involving the lower motor neuron. In this article, lower motor neuron lesions are discussed. The features of motor neuronopathies and, to a lesser extent, motor axonal lesions are considered. "

We used single neuron extracellular recordings in awake human subjects undergoing surgery for Parkinson disease to characterize the features and timing of this response in the substantia nigra. We recorded 49 neurons in the substantia nigra. Using an auditory oddball task, we showed that they fired more rapidly following novel sounds than repetitive tones. The response was biphasic with peaks at approximately 250 ms, comparable to that described in primate studies, and a second peak at 500 ms. This response was primarily driven by slower firing neurons as firing rate was inversely correlated to novelty response. Our data provide human validation of the purported role of dopamine neurons in novelty detection and suggest modifications to proposed models of novelty detection circuitry. "

In human Duchenne muscular dystrophy, loss of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin is thought to cause impairments in cognition, including learning and memory. Previous studies demonstrate that loss of dystrophin causes dysfunctional signaling at γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synapses on Purkinje neurons, presumably by destabilization of \{GABAA\} receptors. However, potential differences in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of Purkinje neurons, including membrane potential and action potential firing rates, have not been investigated. Here, using a 2 × 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) experimental design, we employed patch clamp analysis to compare membrane properties and action potentials generated by acutely dissociated Purkinje neurons from vermal and lateral cerebellum in wild-type (WT) mice and mdx dystrophin-deficient mice. Compared to Purkinje neurons from \{WT\} mice, neurons from mdx mice exhibited more irregular action potential firing and a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. Firing frequency was also lower in Purkinje neurons from the lateral cerebellum of mdx mice relative to those from \{WT\} mice. Several action potential waveform parameters differed between vermal and lateral Purkinje neurons, irrespective of dystrophin status, including action potential amplitude, slope (both larger in the vermal region), and duration (shorter in the vermal region). Moreover, the membrane potential of Purkinje neurons from the vermal region of \{WT\} mice exhibited a significant hyperpolarization and concurrent reduction in the frequency of spontaneous action potentials compared to Purkinje neurons from the lateral region. This regional hyperpolarization and reduction in spontaneous action potential frequency was abolished in mdx mice. These results from mice demonstrate the presence of differential electrophysiological properties between Purkinje neurons from different regions of the \{WT\} mouse cerebellum and altered intrinsic membrane properties in the absence of dystrophin. These findings provide a possible mechanism for the observations that absence of cerebellar dystrophin contributes to deficits in mental function observed in humans and mouse models of muscular dystrophy. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of distinguishing functional zones of the cerebellum in future work characterizing Purkinje neuron electrophysiology and studies using the model of dissociated Purkinje neurons from mice.

Understanding the effects of paclitaxel on sensory neuronal function and the signaling pathways which mediate these paclitaxel-induced changes in function are critical for the development of therapies to prevent or alleviate the PN. The effects of long-term administration of paclitaxel on the function of sensory neurons grown in culture, using the release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) as an endpoint of sensory neuronal function, were examined. Dorsal root ganglion cultures were treated with low (10 nM) and high (300 nM) concentrations of paclitaxel for 1, 3, or 5 days. Following paclitaxel treatment, the release of \{CGRP\} was determined using capsaicin, a \{TRPV1\} agonist; allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a \{TRPA1\} agonist; or high extracellular potassium. The effects of paclitaxel on the release of \{CGRP\} were stimulant-, concentration-, and time-dependent. When neurons were stimulated with capsaicin or AITC, a low concentration of paclitaxel (10 nM) augmented transmitter release, whereas a high concentration (300 nM) reduced transmitter release in a time-dependent manner; however, when high extracellular potassium was used as the evoking stimulus, all concentrations of paclitaxel augmented \{CGRP\} release from sensory neurons. These results suggest that paclitaxel alters the function of sensory neurons in vitro, and suggest that the mechanisms by which paclitaxel alters neuronal function may include functional changes in \{TRP\} channel activity. The described in vitro model will facilitate future studies to identify the signaling pathways by which paclitaxel alters neuronal sensitivity. "

Aim To identify spinal and brains neurons involved in the control of the levator ani (LA) and bulbospongiosus (BS) in the male adult and preadolescent rat. Methods Rats were anesthetized, and the transsynaptic retrograde tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) was injected into the \{LA\} muscle of adults or the ventral \{BS\} muscle in 30‐day‐old rats. After 3–5 days rats were sacrificed, and PRV‐labeled neurons in the spinal cords and brains were identified using immunohistochemistry. The presence of gastrin‐releasing peptide (GRP) in the lumbar spinal neurons was examined. Main Outcomes Measures The location and number of PRV‐labeled neurons in the spinal cord and brain and \{GRP\} colocalization in the lumbar spinal cord. Results PRV‐labeled spinal interneurons were found distributed throughout T11‐S1 of the spinal cord, subsequent to dorsal medial motoneuron infection. The majority of spinal interneurons were found in the lumbosacral spinal cord in the region of the dorsal gray commissure and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons. Preadolescent rats had more PRV‐labeled spinal interneurons at L5‐S1 where the motoneurons were located but relatively less spread rostrally in the spinal cord compared with adults. Lumbar spinothalmic neurons in medial gray of L3‐L4 co‐localized \{PRV\} and GRP. In the brain consistent labeling was seen in areas known to be involved in male sexual behavior including the ventrolateral medulla, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, and medial preoptic area. Conclusion Common spinal and brain pathways project to the \{LA\} and \{BS\} muscles in the rat suggesting that these muscles act together to coordinate male sexual reflexes.

Future therapeutic efforts may benefit from the development of models that enable basic investigation of early disease pathology. In particular, disease-relevant models based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) may be promising approaches to assess the impact of neurotoxic agents in \{AD\} on specific neuronal populations and thereby facilitate the development of novel interventions to avert early disease mechanisms. We implemented an efficient paradigm to convert hPSCs into enriched populations of cortical glutamatergic neurons emerging from dorsal forebrain neural progenitors, aided by modulating Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Since \{AD\} is generally known to be toxic to glutamatergic circuits, we exposed glutamatergic neurons derived from hESCs to an oligomeric pre-fibrillar forms of Aβ known as “globulomers”, which have shown strong correlation with the level of cognitive deficits in AD. Administration of such Aβ oligomers yielded signs of the disease, including cell culture age-dependent binding of Aβ and cell death in the glutamatergic populations. Furthermore, consistent with previous findings in postmortem human \{AD\} brain, Aβ-induced toxicity was selective for glutamatergic rather than \{GABAeric\} neurons present in our cultures. This in vitro model of cortical glutamatergic neurons thus offers a system for future mechanistic investigation and therapeutic development for \{AD\} pathology using human cell types specifically affected by this disease.

This study investigated the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of Aβ (1 pM–100 nM), fragment 25–35, on glycine-mediated membrane current in acutely isolated rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We have found that short (600 ms) co-application of glycine with Aβ caused reversible dose-dependent and voltage-independent acceleration of desensitization of glycine current. The peak amplitude of the current remained unchanged. The effect of picomolar Aβ concentrations persisted in the presence of 1 µM Aβ in the pipette solution, implying that Aβ bounds to extracellular site(s). Concentration-dependence curve was N-shaped with maximums at 100 pM and 100 nM, suggesting the existence of two binding sites, which may interact with each other. Glycine current resistant to 100 µM picrotoxin, was insensitive to Aβ, which suggests that Aβ affected mainly homomeric glycine receptors. When Aβ was added to bath solution, besides acceleration of desensitization, it caused reversible dose-dependent reduction of glycine current peak amplitude. These results demonstrate that physiological (picomolar) concentrations of Aβ reversibly augment the desensitization of glycine current, probably by binding to external sites on homomeric glycine receptors. Furthermore, Aβ can suppress the peak amplitude of glycine current, but this effect develops slowly and may be mediated through some intracellular machinery. "

In this study, we tested the activity of a low molecular weight fraction from the venom of P. caribaeorum on voltage-gated sodium channels of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons of the rat. Our results showed that this fraction delays tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium channel inactivation indicated by a reversible 2-fold increase of the current at the decay. A peptide responsible for this activity was isolated and characterized. Its sequence showed that it does not resemble any previously reported toxin. Together, these results evidence the presence of neurotoxins in P. caribaeorum that act on sodium channels. "

Most studies to date have focused on developmental neurotoxicity applications. This study reports the development of a robust multiparameter High Content Analysis (HCA) assay for neurotoxicity screening in three differentiated neuronal cell models – SH-SY5Y, \{PC12\} and human embryonic stem cell-derived hN2™ cells. Using a multiplexed detection reagent panel (Hoechst nuclear stain; antibodies against βIII-Tubulin and phosphorylated neurofilament subunit H, and Mitotracker® Red CMXRos), a multiparametric \{HCA\} assay was developed and used to characterize a test set of 36 chemicals. \{HCA\} data generated were compared to data generated using \{MTT\} and \{LDH\} assays under the same assay conditions. Data showed that multiparametric High Content Analysis of differentiated neuronal cells is feasible, and represents a highly effective method for obtaining large quantities of robust data on the neurotoxic effects of compounds compared with cytotoxicity assays like \{MTT\} and LDH. Significant differences were observed between the responses to compounds across the three cellular models tested, illustrating the heterogeneity in responses to neurotoxicants across different cell types. This study provides data strongly supporting the use of cellular imaging as a tool for neurotoxicity assessment in differentiated neuronal cells, and provides novel insights into the neurotoxic effects of a test set of compounds upon differentiated neuronal cell lines and human embryonic stem cell-derived neurons.

In this study, we investigated the regulatory effects between \{SMN\} expression and miR-9a, a downstream noncoding small RNA. Using an inducible \{SMN\} short hairpin \{RNA\} interference (shRNAi) system in \{NSC\} 34 and human skin fibroblast cells, cellular miR-9 levels and \{SMN\} protein repression were time-dependently upregulated. Conversely, cellular miR-9 levels decreased when HeLa cells were transfected with \{SMN\} protein fused with green fluorescent protein. In SMA-like mice spinal cords and human primary skin fibroblasts isolated from patients with different degrees of SMA, human \{SMN\} exhibited a disease severity-dependent decrease, whereas cellular miR-9 levels increased. These results clearly suggested that cellular \{SMN\} proteins regulated miR-9 expression and that miR-9 expression was related to \{SMA\} severity. Thus, miR-9 may be a marker for \{SMA\} prognosis.

Although many studies in the past decades have supported this hypothesis, there had been concerns about its validity until recently. One recurring claim had been that 5-HT neurons are not consistently sensitive to hypercapnia in vivo. Another belief was that 5-HT neurons do not stimulate breathing; instead, they inhibit or modulate respiratory output. It was also believed by some that 5-HT neuron chemosensitivity is dependent on \{TASK\} channels, but mice with genetic deletion of TASK-1 and TASK-3 have a normal hypercapnic ventilatory response. This review explains why these principal arguments against the hypothesis are not supported by existing data. Despite repeated challenges, a large body of evidence now supports the conclusion that at least a subset of 5-HT neurons are central chemoreceptors. "

Previous work indicating that molecular sensitization to dopamine receptor \{D1\} (D1R) stimulation is involved in dyskinesias prompted us to perform electrophysiological recordings of striatal projection “medium spiny neurons” (MSN). Moreover, because enhanced \{D1R\} signaling in drug abuse induces changes in spine density in striatum, we investigated whether the dyskinesia is related to morphological changes in MSNs. Methods Wild-type and bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice (D1R-tomato and D2R–green fluorescent protein) mice were lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine and subsequently treated with L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia. Functional, molecular, and structural changes were assessed in corticostriatal slices. Individual \{MSNs\} injected with Lucifer-Yellow were detected by immunohistochemistry for three-dimensional reconstructions with Neurolucida software. Intracellular current-clamp recordings with high-resistance micropipettes were used to characterize electrophysiological parameters. Results Both D1R-MSNs and D2R-MSNs showed diminished spine density in totally denervated striatal regions in parkinsonian mice. Chronic L-DOPA treatment, which induced dyskinesia and aberrant FosB expression, restored spine density in D2R-MSNs but not in D1R-MSNs. In basal conditions, \{MSNs\} are more excitable in parkinsonian than in sham mice, and excitability decreases toward normal values after L-DOPA treatment. Despite this normalization of basal excitability, in dyskinetic mice, the selective \{D1R\} agonist \{SKF38393\} increased the number of evoked action potentials in MSNs, compared with sham animals. Conclusions Chronic L-DOPA induces abnormal spine re-growth exclusively in D2R-MSNs and robust supersensitization to D1R-activated excitability in denervated striatal MSNs. These changes might constitute the anatomical and electrophysiological substrates of dyskinesia. "

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IR fibers were observed close to neurons expressing β2-AR-IR. Since β2-AR is virtually expressed in most neurons located in the horse \{SMP\} and in a lower percentage of neurons in the MP, it is reasonable to retain that this adrenergic receptor could regulate the activity of both secretomotor neurons and motor neurons innervating muscle layers and blood vessels.

Although glia are known to promote sensory-neuron functions, the molecular bases of these interactions are poorly explored. Here, we describe a post-developmental glial role for the PROS-1/Prospero/PROX1 homeodomain protein in sensory-neuron function in C. elegans. Using glia expression profiling, we demonstrate that, unlike previously characterized cell fate roles, PROS-1 functions post-embryonically to control sense-organ glia-specific secretome expression. PROS-1 functions cell autonomously to regulate glial secretion and membrane structure, and non-cell autonomously to control the shape and function of the receptive endings of sensory neurons. Known glial genes controlling sensory-neuron function are PROS-1 targets, and we identify additional PROS-1-dependent genes required for neuron attributes. Drosophila Prospero and vertebrate \{PROX1\} are expressed in post-mitotic sense-organ glia and astrocytes, suggesting conserved roles for this class of transcription factors. "

Previous results indicate that the spherical neuron’s intrinsic properties depend mainly on the presence of two resonant currents that tend to clamp the voltage near the resting potential. Here we show that these are: a low-threshold potassium current blocked by 4-aminopyridine and a mixed cationic current blocked by cesium chloride. We also show that the low-threshold potassium current also causes the long refractory period, explaining the necessary properties that implement the dynamic filtering of the self-generated signals previously described. Comparative data from other fish and from the auditory system indicate that other single spiking onset neurons might differ in the channel repertoire observed in the spherical neurons of Gymnotus omarorum.

Methods To establish a model of oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) and reperfusion, cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to \{OGD\} for 2.5 hours, followed by a 24-hour reoxygenation. Cultured hippocampal neurons were randomly divided into control group, model group (vehicle), and ginsenoside Rg1 treatment groups (5μM, 20μM, 60μM). At 24 hours post-OGD, the intracellular free calcium concentration was detected using Furo-3/AM-loaded hippocampal neurons deprived of oxygen and glucose. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity was measured by chemical colorimetry. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst staining, and the neuron viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Results Excitotoxic neuronal injury of \{OGD\} was demonstrated by the increase of intracellular free calcium concentrations and elevated nNOS activity in the model group compared with the control group. The intracellular free calcium concentrations and the nNOS activity in the groups receiving intermediate and high dose of ginsenoside Rg1 were significantly lower than those of the control group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, intermediate and high dose of ginsenoside Rg1 administration could also attenuate the cell viability loss (p &lt; 0.05) and cell apoptosis induced by OGD. Conclusion Ginsenoside Rg1 has neuroprotective effect on ischemia–reperfusion injury in cultured hippocampal cells mediated by blocking calcium over-influx into neuronal cells and decreasing the nNOS activity after \{OGD\} exposure. We infer that ginsenoside Rg1 may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for cerebral ischemia injury. "

MrgprA3, one of members of the Mrgprs family, is specifically expressed in a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). These MrgprA3-expressing \{DRG\} neurons have been identified as itch-specific neurons. They can be activated by the compound, chloroquine, which is used as a drug to treat malaria. In the present study, we labeled these itch-specific neurons using the method of molecular genetic markers, and then studied their electrophysiological properties. We also recorded the cutaneous MrgprA3− neurons retrogradely labeled by Dil dye (MrgprA3−-Dil). We first found that MrgprA3+ neurons have a lower excitability than MrgprA3− neurons (MrgprA3−-non-Dil and MrgprA3−-Dil). The number of action potential (AP) was reduced more obviously in MrgprA3+ neurons than that of in MrgprA3− neurons. In most cases, MrgprA3+ neurons only generated single AP; however, in MrgprA3− neurons, the same stimulation could induce multiple \{AP\} firing due to the greater voltage-gated potassium (Kv) current existence in MrgprA3+ than in MrgprA3− neurons. Thus, Kv current plays an important role in the regulation of excitability in itch-specific neurons. "

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with ketamine-induced neurotoxicity, stem cell-derived models, such as rodent neural stem cells harvested from rat fetuses and/or neural stem cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can be utilized. Prolonged exposure of rodent neural stem cells to clinically-relevant concentrations of ketamine resulted in elevated \{NMDA\} receptor levels as indicated by \{NR1subunit\} over-expression in neurons. This was associated with enhanced damage in neurons. In contrast, the viability and proliferation rate of undifferentiated neural stem cells were not significantly affected after ketamine exposure. Calcium imaging data indicated that 50 μM \{NMDA\} did not cause a significant influx of calcium in typical undifferentiated neural stem cells; however, it did produce an immediate elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ [Ca2+]i in differentiated neurons derived from the same neural stem cells. This paper reviews the literature on this subject and previous findings suggest that prolonged exposure of developing neurons to ketamine produces an increase in \{NMDA\} receptor expression (compensatory up-regulation) which allows for a higher/toxic influx of calcium into neurons once ketamine is removed from the system, leading to neuronal cell death likely due to elevated reactive oxygen species generation. The absence of functional \{NMDA\} receptors in cultured neural stem cells likely explains why clinically-relevant concentrations of ketamine did not affect undifferentiated neural stem cell viability.

In vertebrates, Vangl2 plays an essential role in convergence and extension (CE) movements during gastrulation and in facial branchiomotor (FBM) neuron migration in the hindbrain. However, the roles of specific Vangl2 domains, of membrane association, and of specific extracellular and intracellular motifs have not been examined, especially in the context of \{FBM\} neuron migration. Through heat shock-inducible expression of various Vangl2 transgenes, we found that membrane associated functions of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Vangl2 are involved in regulating \{FBM\} neuron migration. Importantly, through temperature shift experiments, we found that the critical period for Vangl2 function coincides with the initial stages of \{FBM\} neuron migration out of rhombomere 4. Intriguingly, we have also uncovered a putative nuclear localization motif in the C-terminal domain that may play a role in regulating \{CE\} movements. "

abstract = "Abstract We have previously developed a rat hippocampal neuronal cell model for the registration of the preconditioning effect and posthypoxic hyperexcitability (Turovskaya et al., 2011). Repeated episodes of short-term hypoxia are reported to suppress the amplitude of Ca2 + response to \{NMDA\} in majority of neurons, reflecting the effect of preconditioning in the culture. In addition, exposure to hypoxia causes posthypoxic hyperexcitability: this is characterized by the onset of spontaneous synchronous Ca2 + transients in a population of neurons in a neural network during the period of reoxygenation after each hypoxic episode. The nature of this phenomenon is unknown, although it has been observed that there always exists a minority of neurons in which there is no effect of hypoxic preconditioning. In this small population of neurons, the amplitude of Ca2 + response to \{NMDA\} is not suppressed, but rather increases after each episode of hypoxia. Here we report the type of these neurons and their role in the generation of posthypoxic hyperexcitability. We compared the effect of short-term hypoxia on the amplitude of the Ca2 + response to \{NMDA\} and the Ca2 + transient generation in two populations of neurons — inhibitory \{GABAergic\} and excitatory glutamatergic. We have demonstrated that the neurons in which the preconditioning effect was not observed are GABAergic. Moreover at the instant moment of the posthypoxic synchronous Ca2 +-transient generation (during reoxygenation) there is a global increase of [Ca2 +]i and subsequent apoptosis in some \{GABAergic\} neurons. Anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 prevents the development of posthypoxic hyperexcitability, inhibiting the spontaneous synchronous Ca2 + transients. At the same time, interleukin-10 protects \{GABAergic\} neurons from death, by restoring the effect of hypoxic preconditioning in them. Activation of one of the signaling pathways initiated by interleukin-10 appears to be necessary for the development of hypoxic preconditioning in \{GABAergic\} neurons. Overall our results indicate that short-term episodes of hypoxia can damage \{GABAergic\} neurons and weaken the inhibitory action of \{GABAergic\} neurons in a neural network. Activation of PI3K-dependent survival signaling pathways in neurons of this type is a possible strategy to protect these cells against hypoxia. "

Although tonically active α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been shown to sustain spontaneous glutamate transmission to \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices under resting conditions, it remains to be determined whether these receptors are those expressed by \{CA3\} or \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the \{CA3\} field of the hippocampus is a significant source of α7 nAChR-sustained glutamatergic transmission to \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons. To this end, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded from \{CA1\} and \{CA3\} pyramidal neurons in intact rat hippocampal slices as well as from \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons in CA3-ablated slices under various experimental conditions. Surgical removal of the \{CA3\} region from the slices reduced by 20% the frequency of spontaneous \{EPSCs\} recorded from \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons. This finding is in agreement with the concept that the \{CA3\} field contributes significantly to the maintenance of spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic activity in \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons. In addition, the α7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA, 10 nM) reduced the frequency of spontaneous \{EPSCs\} recorded from \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons by 30% in intact slices and 12% in CA3-ablated slices. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tonically active α7 nAChRs in \{CA3\} pyramidal neurons and/or in the Mossy fibers that innervate the \{CA3\} pyramidal neurons do in fact contribute to the maintenance of glutamatergic synaptic activity in \{CA1\} pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices under resting conditions.

Recent evidence suggests that factors secreted by activated astrocytes might contribute to degeneration of MNs. We focused on endothelin-1 (ET-1), a peptide which is strongly up-regulated in reactive astrocytes under different pathological conditions. We show that ET-1 is abundantly expressed by reactive astrocytes in the spinal cord of the SOD1-G93A mouse model and sporadic \{ALS\} patients. To test if ET-1 might play a role in degeneration of MNs, we investigated its effect on \{MN\} survival in an in vitro model of mixed rat spinal cord cultures (MSCs) enriched of astrocytes exhibiting a reactive phenotype. ET-1 exerted a toxic effect on \{MNs\} in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with an exposure to 100–200 nM ET-1 for 48 h resulting in 40–50% \{MN\} cell death. Importantly, ET-1 did not induce \{MN\} degeneration when administered on cultures treated with AraC (5 μM) or grown in a serum-free medium that did not favor astrocyte proliferation and reactivity. We found that both \{ETA\} and \{ETB\} receptors are enriched in astrocytes in MSCs. The ET-1 toxic effect was mimicked by ET-3 (100 nM) and sarafotoxin \{S6c\} (10 nM), two selective agonists of endothelin-B receptors, and was not additive with that of ET-3 suggesting the involvement of \{ETB\} receptors. Surprisingly, however, the ET-1 effect persisted in the presence of the \{ETB\} receptor antagonist BQ-788 (200 nM–2 μM) and was slightly reversed by the \{ETA\} receptor antagonist BQ-123 (2 μM), suggesting an atypical pharmacological profile of the astrocytic receptors responsible for ET-1 toxicity. The ET-1 effect was not undone by the ionotropic glutamate receptor \{AMPA\} antagonist \{GYKI\} 52466 (20 μM), indicating that it is not caused by an increased glutamate release. Conversely, a 48-hour ET-1 treatment increased \{MN\} cell death induced by acute exposure to \{AMPA\} (50 μM), which is indicative of two distinct pathways leading to neuronal death. Altogether these results indicate that ET-1 exerts a toxic effect on cultured \{MNs\} through mechanisms mediated by reactive astrocytes and suggest that ET-1 may contribute to \{MN\} degeneration in ALS. Thus, a treatment aimed at lowering ET-1 levels or antagonizing its effect might be envisaged as a potential therapeutic strategy to slow down \{MN\} degeneration in this devastating disease. "

Extensive studies during the past decades have provided compelling evidence that estradiol has the potential to alter the intracellular signal transduction mechanisms. The common target of many signaling pathways is the phosphorylation of a key transcription factor, the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This review first addresses the aspects of estradiol action on \{CREB\} phosphorylation (pCREB) in GnRH neurons.

The previous study indicated that \{BPA\} rapidly increased motility and density of dendritic filopodia and enhanced the phosphorylation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit \{NR2B\} in cultured hippocampal neurons within 30 min. The purpose of the present study was further to investigate the effects of \{BPA\} for 24 h on dendritic morphogenesis and the underlying mechanisms. After cultured for 5 d in vitro, the hippocampal neurons from 24 h-old rat were infected by AdV-EGFP to indicate time-lapse imaging of living neurons. The results demonstrated that the exposure of the cultured hippocampal neurons to \{BPA\} (10, 100 nM) or 17β-estradiol (17β-E2, 10 nM) for 24 h significantly promoted dendritic development, as evidenced by the increased total length of dendrite and the enhanced motility and density of dendritic filopodia. However, these changes were suppressed by an \{ERs\} antagonist, ICI182,780, a non-competitive \{NMDA\} receptor antagonist, MK-801, and a mitogen-activated ERK1/2-activating kinase (MEK1/2) inhibitor, U0126. Meanwhile, the increased F-actin (filamentous actin) induced by \{BPA\} (100 nM) was also completely eliminated by these blockers. Furthermore, the result of western blot analyses showed that, the exposure of the cultures to \{BPA\} or 17β-E2 for 24 h promoted the expression of Rac1/Cdc42 but inhibited that of RhoA, suggesting Rac1 (Ras related \{C3\} botulinum toxinsubstrate 1)/Cdc42 (cell divisioncycle 42) and RhoA (Ras homologous A), the Rho family of small GTPases, were involved in BPA- or 17β-E2-induced changes in the dendritic morphogenesis of neurons. These BPA- or 17β-E2-induced effects were completely blocked by ICI182,780, and were partially suppressed by U0126. These results reveal that, similar to 17β-E2, \{BPA\} exerts its effects on dendritic morphogenesis by eliciting both nuclear actions and extranuclear-initiated actions that are integrated to influence the development of dendrite in hippocampal neurons.

Painful experiences during this period can result in long-term alterations in the neurocircuitry underlying nociception, including increased sensitivity to mechanical or thermal stimuli. Less is known about the impact of neonatal exposure to mild inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on subsequent inflammatory pain responses. Here we examine the impact of neonatal \{LPS\} exposure on inflammatory pain sensitivity and \{HPA\} axis activity during the first three postnatal weeks. Wistar rats were injected with \{LPS\} (0.05 mg/kg IP, Salmonella enteritidis) or saline on postnatal days (PNDs) 3 and 5 and later subjected to the formalin test at \{PNDs\} 7, 13, and 22. One hour after formalin injection, blood was collected to assess corticosterone responses. Transverse spinal cord slices were also prepared for whole-cell patch clamp recording from lumbar superficial dorsal horn neurons (SDH). Brains were obtained at \{PND\} 22 and the hypothalamus was isolated to measure glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) transcript expression using qRT-PCR. Behavioural analyses indicate that at \{PND\} 7, no significant differences were observed between saline- or LPS-challenged rats. At \{PND\} 13, LPS-challenged rats exhibited enhanced licking (p &lt; .01), and at \{PND\} 22, increased flinching in response to formalin injection (p &lt; .05). LPS-challenged rats also displayed increased plasma corticosterone at \{PND\} 7 and \{PND\} 22 (p &lt; .001) but not at \{PND\} 13 following formalin administration. Furthermore, at \{PND\} 22 neonatal \{LPS\} exposure induced decreased levels of \{GR\} mRNA and increased levels of \{MR\} mRNA in the hypothalamus. The intrinsic properties of \{SDH\} neurons were similar at \{PND\} 7 and \{PND\} 13. However, at \{PND\} 22, ipsilateral \{SDH\} neurons in LPS-challenged rats had a lower input resistance compared to their saline-challenged counterparts (p &lt; .05). These data suggest neonatal \{LPS\} exposure produces developmentally regulated changes in formalin-induced behavioural responses, corticosterone levels, and dorsal horn neuron properties following noxious stimulation later in life. These findings highlight the importance of immune activation during the neonatal period in shaping pain sensitivity later in life. This programming involves both spinal cord neurons and the \{HPA\} axis. "

abstract = "Abstract Nogo-A is a transmembrane protein originally discovered in myelin, produced by postnatal \{CNS\} oligodendrocytes. Nogo-A induces growth cone collapse and inhibition of axonal growth in the injured adult CNS. In the intact CNS, Nogo-A functions as a negative regulator of growth and plasticity. Nogo-A is also expressed by certain neurons. Neuronal Nogo-A depresses long-term potentiation in the hippocampus and modulates neurite adhesion and fasciculation during development in mice. Here we show that Nogo-A is present in neurons derived from human midbrain (Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) cell line), as well as in embryonic and postnatal mouse midbrain (dopaminergic) neurons. In \{LUHMES\} cells, Nogo-A was upregulated threefold upon differentiation and neurite extension. Nogo-A was localized intracellularly in differentiated \{LUHMES\} cells. Cultured midbrain (dopaminergic) neurons from Nogo-A knock-out mice exhibited decreased numbers of neurites and branches when compared with neurons from wild-type (WT) mice. However, this phenotype was not observed when the cultures from \{WT\} mice were treated with an antibody neutralizing plasma membrane Nogo-A. In vivo, neither the regeneration of nigrostriatal tyrosine hydroxylase fibers, nor the survival of nigral dopaminergic neurons after partial 6-hydroxydopamine lesions was affected by Nogo-A deletion. These results indicate that during maturation of cultured midbrain (dopaminergic) neurons, intracellular Nogo-A supports neurite growth initiation and branch formation. "

In the amygdala, neurons expressing \{SST\} play an important role in the regulation of anxiety, often comorbid in these disorders. We tested the hypothesis that SST-immunoreactive (IR) neurons are decreased in the amygdala of subjects with \{SZ\} and BD. Evidence for circadian \{SST\} expression in the amygdala and disrupted circadian rhythms and rhythmic peaks of anxiety in \{BD\} suggest a disruption of rhythmic expression of \{SST\} in this disorder. Methods Amygdala sections from 12 SZ, 15 BD, and 15 control subjects were processed for immunocytochemistry for \{SST\} and neuropeptide Y (NPY), a neuropeptide partially co-expressed in SST-IR neurons. Total numbers (Nt) of \{IR\} neurons were measured. Time of death (TOD) was used to test associations with circadian rhythms. Results SST-IR neurons were decreased in the lateral amygdala nucleus in \{BD\} (Nt, p= 0.003) and \{SZ\} (Nt, p=0.02). In normal controls, Nt of SST-IR neurons varied according to TOD. This pattern was altered in BD, characterized by decreases of SST-IR neurons selectively in subjects with \{TOD\} corresponding to the day (06:00-17:59). Numbers of NPY-IR neurons were not affected. Conclusions Decreased SST-IR neurons in the amygdala of \{SZ\} and BD, interpreted here as decreased \{SST\} expression, may disrupt responses to fear and anxiety regulation in these subjects. In BD, our findings raise the possibility that morning peaks of anxiety depend on a disruption of circadian regulation of \{SST\} expression in the amygdala. "

Neonatal and 1-year-old guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral naris-occlusion, followed 1 and 2 months later by morphometry of DCX+ cells in the piriform cortex. DCX+ somata and processes were reduced in the deprived relative to the non-deprived piriform cortex in both age groups at the two surviving time points. The number of DCX+ cells was decreased in the deprived side relative to internal control at 1 and 2 months in the youths and at 2 months in the adults post-occlusion. The mean somal area of DCX+ cells showed a trend of decrease in the deprived side relative to the internal control in the youths. In addition, DCX+ cells in the deprived side exhibited a lower frequency of colocalization with the neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN) relative to counterparts. These results suggest that normal olfactory experience is required for the maintenance and development of DCX+ immature neurons in postnatal and adult guinea pig piriform cortex. "

This is important because it implies that regrowth of distal terminals, rather than neuron replacement or rescue, may be useful clinically. Although a number of neuronal molecular abnormalities have been examined in experimental DPN, several are prominent: loss of structural proteins, neuropeptides, and neurotrophic receptors; upregulation of “stress” and “repair” proteins; elevated nitric oxide synthesis; increased AGE-RAGE signaling, NF-κB and PKC; altered neuron survival pathways; changes of pain-related ion channel investment. There is also a role for abnormalities of direct signaling of neurons by insulin, an important trophic factor for neurons that express its receptors. While evidence implicating each of these pathways has emerged, how they link together and result in neuronal degeneration remains unclear. However, several offer interesting new avenues for more definitive therapy of this condition. "

To investigate the effects of antigen-specific IgLC activation, intracellular recordings were made from cultured murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which can specifically bind IgLC. The neurons were sensitized with IgLC for 90 min and subsequently activated by application of the corresponding antigen (DNP-HSA). Antigen application induced a decrease in the rate of rise of the action potentials of non-nociceptive neurons (MANOVA, p = 2.10− 6), without affecting the resting membrane potential or firing threshold. The action potentials of the nociceptive neurons (p = 0.57) and the electrical excitability of both types of neurons (p &gt; 0.35) were not affected. We conclude that IgLC can mediate antigen-specific responses by reducing the rate of rise of action potentials in non-nociceptive murine \{DRG\} neurons.

In this view, S1R, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident receptor with chaperone-like activity, has recently attracted great interest. \{S1R\} is involved in several processes leading to acute and chronic neurodegeneration, including \{ALS\} pathology. Treatment with the \{S1R\} agonist PRE-084 improves locomotor function and motor neuron survival in presymptomatic and early symptomatic mutant SOD1-G93A \{ALS\} mice. Here, we tested the efficacy of PRE-084 in a model of spontaneous motor neuron degeneration, the wobbler mouse (wr) as a proof of concept that \{S1R\} may be regarded as a key therapeutic target also for \{ALS\} cases not linked to \{SOD1\} mutation. Increased staining for \{S1R\} was detectable in morphologically spared cervical spinal cord motor neurons of wr mice both at early (6th week) and late (12th week) phases of clinical progression. \{S1R\} signal was also detectable in hypertrophic astrocytes and reactive microglia of wr mice. Chronic treatment with PRE-084 (three times a week, for 8 weeks), starting at symptom onset, significantly increased the levels of \{BDNF\} in the gray matter, improved motor neuron survival and ameliorated paw abnormality and grip strength performance. In addition, the treatment significantly reduced the number of reactive astrocytes whereas, that of \{CD11b\} + microglial cells was increased. A deeper evaluation of microglial markers revealed significant increased number of cells positive for the pan-macrophage marker \{CD68\} and of \{CD206\} + cells, involved in tissue restoration, in the white matter of PRE-084-treated mice. The mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were not affected by PRE-084 treatment. Thus, our results support pharmacological manipulation of \{S1R\} as a promising strategy to cure \{ALS\} and point to increased availability of growth factors and modulation of astrocytosis and of macrophage/microglia as part of the mechanisms involved in S1R-mediated neuroprotection.

An important problem with using \{ANN\} for time series forecasting is to determine the number of neurons in hidden layer. There have been some approaches in the literature to deal with the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer. A new \{ANN\} model was suggested which is called multiplicative neuron model (MNM) in the literature. \{MNM\} has only one neuron in hidden layer. Therefore, the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer is automatically solved when \{MNM\} is employed. Also, \{MNM\} can produce accurate forecasts for non-linear time series. \{ANN\} models utilized for non-linear time series have generally autoregressive structures since lagged variables of time series are generally inputs of these models. On the other hand, it is a well- known fact that better forecasts for real life time series can be obtained from models whose inputs are lagged variables of error. In this study, a new recurrent multiplicative neuron neural network model is firstly proposed. In the proposed method, lagged variables of error are included in the model. Also, the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer is avoided when the proposed method is used. To train the proposed neural network model, particle swarm optimization algorithm was used. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it was applied to a real life time series. Then, results produced by the proposed method were compared to those obtained from other methods. It was observed that the proposed method has superior performance to existing methods. "

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most profound known regulators of survival in the developing peripheral nervous system (PNS). Whether \{BDNF\} regulates the expression of \{VGLUT3\} and \{VMAT2\} in \{DRG\} neurons is still unclear. In the present study, primary cultured rat \{DRG\} neurons were used to evaluate the effects of \{BDNF\} on \{VGLUT3\} and \{VMAT2\} expression. The signaling pathways of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and the phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-γ) involved in these effects were also determined. \{DRG\} neurons at 48 h post-culture were incubated with \{BDNF\} and/or ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, \{PI3K\} inhibitor LY294002, and PLC-γ inhibitor \{U73122\} for an additional 24 h. After that, the neurite growth and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) expressions after different doses of \{BDNF\} treatment were determined by immunofluorescent labeling. The expression of mRNA and protein of \{VGLUT3\} and \{VMAT2\} in different experimental conditions was assessed by real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescent labeling, respectively. The results showed that \{BDNF\} exposure promoted neurite growth and GAP-43 expression in \{DRG\} neurons in a dose-dependent manner. \{BDNF\} induced \{VGLUT3\} upregulation through activation of PLC-γ signaling pathway. Although \{BDNF\} administration did not elevate the levels of VMAT2, the block of the PI3K/Akt or PLC-γ signaling pathways could inhibit \{VMAT2\} expression in \{DRG\} neurons in the presence of BDNF. The knockdown of \{VGLUT3\} or \{VMAT2\} gene by siRNA did not affect the BDNF's effects on GAP-43 upregulation and neurite growth. The upregulation of \{VGLUT3\} induced by \{BDNF\} might be that \{BDNF\} improved neuronal outgrowth status by promoting GAP-43 expression to stimulate neurite elongation. The contribution of distinct \{VGLUT3\} and \{VMAT2\} transporter expression induced by \{BDNF\} might be one of the mechanisms that \{BDNF\} regulates neuropathic pain. These data imply that \{BDNF\} signaling system might be a potential target on modifying distinct transporter-mediated biological effects of primary sensory neurons. "

These auditory primary afferents, like in other systems (Puopolo and Belluzzi, 1998; Gascon and Moqrich, 2010; Leao et al., 2012) possess a marked diversity in their electrophysiological features (Taberner and Liberman, 2005). Consistent with these observations, when the auditory primary afferents were assessed in neuronal explants separated from their peripheral and central targets it was found that individual neurons were markedly heterogeneous in their endogenous electrophysiological features. One aspect of this heterogeneity, obvious throughout the ganglion, was their wide range of excitability as assessed by voltage threshold measurements (Liu and Davis, 2007). Thus, while neurons in the base differed significantly from apical and middle neurons in their voltage thresholds, each region showed distinctly wide ranges of values. To determine whether the resting membrane potentials (RMPs) of these neurons correlate with the threshold distribution and to identify the ion channel regulatory elements underlying heterogeneous neuronal excitability in the ganglion, patch-clamp recordings were made from postnatal day (P5–8) murine spiral ganglion neurons in vitro. We found that \{RMP\} mirrored the tonotopic threshold distribution, and contributed an additional level of heterogeneity in each cochlear location. Pharmacological experiments further indicated that threshold and \{RMP\} was coupled through the Kv1 current, which had a dual impact on both electrophysiological parameters. Whereas, hyperpolarization-activated cationic channels decoupled these two processes by primarily affecting \{RMP\} without altering threshold level. Thus, beyond mechanical and synaptic specializations, ion channel regulation of intrinsic membrane properties imbues spiral ganglion neurons with different excitability levels, a feature that contributes to primary auditory afferent diversity.

We report a case of rapidly progressive motor neuronopathy following a diagnosis of breast carcinoma, with a presence of anti-Ri antibodies, and a novel \{SOD1\} gene mutation. Observation An 80-year-old woman with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the left breast for 4 years developed sub-acute quadriparesis. Myography revealed chronic denervation signs. The patient had serum anti-Ri onconeural antibodies. The diagnosis of paraneoplastic \{MND\} was established. Because of a familial history of ALS, a genetic analysis for familial \{ALS\} was performed. We identified a novel heterozygous mutation in \{SOD1\} gene, \{SOD\} I18del. This mutation may reflect a genetic predisposition to develop a MND, inducing fragility of motor neurons. Neurological improvement was observed after three months of both intravenous gamma globulin and corticosteroids. Conclusion The present observation supports the idea that \{MND\} can be considered as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A combination of anti-Ri onconeural antibodies and a particular \{SOD1\} gene mutation, consisting in risk factor, might be in cause in the process of motor neuron death. When in doubt, paraneoplastic cause should be suspected in the differential diagnosis of MND. Immunotherapy treatment may lead to a favorable outcome. "

abstract = "Abstract Parkinson's disease is an age-associated disorder characterized by selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of this subset of neurons are, however, not fully understood. Employing SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and primary mesencephalic neurons, we here demonstrate a significant increase in cytosolic calcium after inhibition of mitochondrial complex I by means of MPP+, which is a well-established environmental toxin-based in vitro model of Parkinson's disease. This increase in calcium is correlated with a downregulation of the neuron-specific plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2). Interestingly, two other important mediators of calcium efflux, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), and Na+–Ca2+-exchanger (NCX), remained unaltered, indicating a specific role of \{PMCA2\} in maintaining calcium homeostasis in neurons. The observed \{PMCA2\} downregulation was accompanied by reduced levels of phosphorylated \{CREB\} protein, an intracellular signaling molecule and transcriptional regulator. In order to investigate the potential influence of \{PMCA2\} on neuronal vulnerability, experimental downregulation of \{PMCA2\} by means of siRNA was performed. The results demonstrate a significant impairment of cell survival under conditions of \{PMCA2\} suppression. Hence, in our cell models increased cytosolic calcium levels as a consequence of insufficient calcium efflux lead to an increased vulnerability of neuronal cells. Moreover, overexpression of \{PMCA2\} rendered the neurons significantly resistant to complex I inhibition. Our findings point toward a dysregulation of calcium homeostasis in Parkinson's disease and suggest a potential molecular mechanism of neurodegeneration via PMCA2. "

Maternal supplementation with the \{BH4\} precursor sepiapterin reduces postnatal motor deficits and perinatal deaths after 40-min fetal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) at 70% gestation, suggesting that brain \{BH4\} is important in improving function after HI. We tested the hypothesis that the intrinsically low concentrations of \{BH4\} made fetal neurons vulnerable to added insults. Brains were obtained from naïve fetal rabbits or after 40-min HI, at 70% (E22) and 92% gestation (E29). Neuronal cultures were prepared from basal ganglia, cortex, and thalamus, regions with different intrinsic levels of BH4. Cultures were grown with or without added \{BH4\} for 48 h. Cell survival and mitochondrial function were determined by flow cytometry. At E22, thalamic cells had the lowest survival rate in a BH4-free milieu, in both control and \{HI\} groups, whereas \{BH4\} supplementation ex vivo increased neuronal survival only in \{HI\} cells. Neuronal survival was similar in all regions without \{BH4\} at E29. \{BH4\} supplementation increased cell survival and cells with intact mitochondrial membrane potential, from basal ganglia and cortex, but not thalamus. After \{E29\} HI, however, the benefit of \{BH4\} was limited to cortical neurons. We conclude that \{BH4\} is important for fetal neuronal survival after \{HI\} especially in the premature thalamus. Supplementation of \{BH4\} has a greater benefit at an earlier gestational age. "

To acquire a neural population of cells we differentiated neurons from neuroepithelial stem cells, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. p21-activated kinase mediated sensing of Aβ oligomers was only possible in the 3D environment. Further, the 3D phenotype showed clear effects on F-actin associated proteins, connected to the disease processes.

To investigate the expression and the distributional patterns of peptides in the PVN-RVLM neurons of rats, we used single cell RT-PCR analysis in combination with retrograde tracing. Approximately 80% of PVN-RVLM neurons expressed oxytocin (OT) and 60% expressed dynorphin (Dyn). There were differential distributions of peptides between the subdivisions of PVN-RVLM neurons. The posterior parvocellular subdivision predominantly expressed OT; the dorsal cap subdivision contained much less vasopressin (VP) compared to other subdivisions. In addition, PVN-RVLM neurons preponderantly co-expressed multiple peptides. These results suggest that peptides may contribute to elaborate responses of \{PVN\} to various stimuli. "

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Nurr1 expression in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons. We found that upregulation of neural activity by high \{KCl\} and bicuculline enhances Nurr1 levels, while blockade of its activity by tetrodotoxin reduces Nurr1 levels. The induction of Nurr1 expression was mediated by voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), as shown by cadmium and VDCC-specific inhibitors. Furthermore, calcineurin, but not calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) was critical for the induction. Thus, Nurr1 expression is regulated by \{VDCC\} and calcineurin in a cell-autonomous, neural activity-dependent manner. "

AngII intra-neuronal signaling is mediated, at least in part, by reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide (O2−). Recently, it has been discovered that mitochondria are a major subcellular source of AngII-induced O2−. We have previously reported that over-expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial matrix-localized O2− scavenging enzyme, inhibits AngII intra-neuronal signaling. Interestingly, over-expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), which is believed to be primarily localized to the cytoplasm, similarly inhibits AngII intra-neuronal signaling and provides protection against AngII-mediated neurogenic hypertension. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that CuZnSOD over-expression in central neurons localizes to mitochondria and inhibits AngII intra-neuronal signaling by scavenging mitochondrial O2−. Using a neuronal cell culture model (CATH.a neurons), we demonstrate that both endogenous and adenovirus-mediated over-expressed CuZnSOD (AdCuZnSOD) are present in mitochondria. Furthermore, we show that over-expression of CuZnSOD attenuates the AngII-mediated increase in mitochondrial O2− levels and the AngII-induced inhibition of neuronal potassium current. Taken together, these data clearly show that over-expressed CuZnSOD in neurons localizes in mitochondria, scavenges AngII-induced mitochondrial O2−, and inhibits AngII intra-neuronal signaling. "

To study the roles of α-tocopherol in the cerebellum, we used the α-tocopherol transfer protein for the murine version (Ttpa−/−) mice which lack the α-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP) and are a faithful model of vitamin E deficiency and oxidative stress. When fed vitamin E-deficient diet, Ttpa−/− mice had un-detectable levels of α-tocopherol in plasma and several brain regions. Dietary supplementation with α-tocopherol normalized plasma levels of the vitamin, but only modestly increased its levels in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex, indicating a critical function of brain TTP. Vitamin E deficiency caused an increase in cerebellar oxidative stress evidenced by increased protein nitrosylation, which was prevented by dietary supplementation with the vitamin. Concomitantly, vitamin E deficiency precipitated cellular atrophy and diminished dendritic branching of Purkinje neurons, the predominant output regulator of the cerebellar cortex. The anatomic decline induced by vitamin E deficiency was paralleled by behavioral deficits in motor coordination and cognitive functions that were normalized upon vitamin E supplementation. These observations underscore the essential role of vitamin E and \{TTP\} in maintaining \{CNS\} function, and support the notion that α-tocopherol supplementation may comprise an effective intervention in oxidative stress-related neurological disorders.

To understand the molecular mechanism regulating the migrating process, we considered the migration of mouse precerebellar neurons. Precerebellar neurons originate in the rhombic lip of the hindbrain and show stereotypic, long-distance tangential migration along the circumference of the hindbrain to form precerebellar nuclei at discrete locations. To identify the molecular components underlying this navigation, we screened for genes expressed in the migrating precerebellar neurons. As a result, we identified the following three genes through the screening; Calm1, Septin 11, and Csde1. We report here functional analysis of one of these genes, Csde1, an RNA-binding protein implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of a subset of cellular mRNA, by examining its participation in precerebellar neuronal migration. We found that shRNA-mediated inhibition of Csde1 expression resulted in a failure of precerebellar neurons to complete their migration into their prospective target regions, with many neurons remaining in migratory paths. Furthermore, those that did reach their destination failed to invade the depth of the hindbrain via radial migration. These results have uncovered a crucial role of Csde1 in the proper control of both radial and tangential migration of precerebellar neurons. "

However, a limitation of this system is the difficulty to analyze isolated neurons because these are required to be maintained at a high density. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to develop a simple and cost-effective method for culturing low-density cerebellar granule neurons. Cerebellar granule cells at two different densities (low- and high-density) were co-cultivated in order for the low-density culture to be supported by the paracrine signals from the high-density culture. This method enabled morphology analysis of isolated cerebellar granule neurons without astrocytic feeder cultures or supplements such as B27. Using this method, we investigated the function of a polarity factor. Studies using hippocampal neurons suggested that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is an essential regulator of neuronal polarity, and inhibition of GSK-3 results in the formation of multiple axons. Pharmacological inhibitors for GSK-3 (6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime and lithium chloride) did not cause the formation of multiple axons of cerebellar granule neurons but significantly reduced their length. Consistent results were obtained by introducing kinase-dead form of GSK-3 beta (K85A). These results indicated that GSK-3 is not directly involved in the control of neuronal polarity in cerebellar granule neurons. Overall, this study provides a simple method for culturing low-density cerebellar granule neurons and insights in to the neuronal-type dependent function of GSK-3 in neuronal morphogenesis. "

In the present study, long-term treatment (from \{P1\} to P21) with 17β-estradiol (17β-estradiol) significantly protected the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of weaver mouse by 54%, as was detected by immunohistochemical experiments, using the specific antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). This dopaminergic neuroprotection is in line with our biochemical results showing that 17β-estradiol treatment significantly decreased the high lipid peroxidation levels seen in the \{SN\} of weaver mouse, indicating high oxidative stress. Interestingly, co-administration of 17β-estradiol with N-acetylcysteine (NAC, precursor molecule of glutathione (GSH)) further significantly increased the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the \{SN\} (by 85%), with a parallel further decrease of lipid peroxidation to normal levels. Our results show the in vivo neuroprotective effect of 17β-estradiol, which is strongly enhanced by co administration of NAC, indicating a strong synergistic effect of the two drugs. Furthermore, the main mechanism underlying this neuroprotective action seems to be the reversal of the oxidative stress shown by the high peroxidation levels. These results could be of clinical relevance since both drugs are already used separately in the clinic, 17β-estradiol for treatment of \{PD\} and \{NAC\} as a mucolytic agent and for the treatment of several disorders.

Expression and distribution of \{TERT\} were measured by immunofluorescence labeling and western blot. The expression of cleaved caspase 3 (CC3), Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by western blot. Neuronal apoptosis was measured with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL). The mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by MitoSOX Red staining. Fluorescent probe JC-1 was used to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). We found that \{TERT\} expression increased at 8 h and peaked at 24 h in neurons after OGD. \{CC3\} expression and neuronal apoptosis were induced and peaked at 24 h after OGD. \{TERT\} inhibition significantly increased \{CC3\} expression and neuronal apoptosis after \{OGD\} treatment. Additionally, \{TERT\} inhibition decreased the expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and enhanced \{ROS\} production and ΔΨm dissipation after OGD. These data suggest that \{TERT\} plays a neuroprotective role via anti-apoptosis in neurons after OGD. The underlying mechanisms may be associated with regulating Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio, attenuating \{ROS\} generation, and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential. "

Several alternate isoforms exist for each subunit (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2 and γ3). However, little is known of the expression pattern or function of the individual catalytic complexes in regulating neuronal structure. In this study, we examined the role of \{AMPK\} subunits in differentiating hippocampal neurons. We found that during development, the expression of \{AMPK\} subunits increase and that activation of \{AMPK\} by energetic stress inhibits neuronal development at multiple stages, not only during axon outgrowth, but also during dendrite growth and arborization. The presence of a single functional \{AMPK\} catalytic complex was sufficient to mediate these inhibitory effects of energetic stress. Activation of \{AMPK\} mediates these effects by suppressing both the mTOR and Akt signaling pathways. These findings demonstrate that the energy-sensing \{AMPK\} pathway regulates neuronal structure in distinct regions of developing neurons at multiple stages of development. "

abstract = "Abstract The neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) has anti-inflammatory properties and promotes expression of neurotrophic factors in the central nervous system (CNS) via activation of glial adrenoceptors. Here we examined the ability of conditioned media (CM) from NA-treated glial cells to impact upon neuronal complexity. Primary rat cortical neurons were treated either directly with \{NA\} (1–10 μM), or treated with \{CM\} from NA-stimulated primary mixed glial cells. Neuronal complexity was assessed using Sholl analysis. Exposure of neurons to \{CM\} from NA-stimulated glial cells increased all indices of neuronal complexity, whereas direct exposure of neurons to \{NA\} did not. \{CM\} from NA-stimulated astrocytes, but not microglia, also increased neuronal complexity indicating a key role for astrocytes. The β-adrenergic subtype was implicated in this response as the increase was blocked by the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propanolol, but not by the α-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. \{CM\} from glial cells treated with the β2-adrenoceptor agonists salmeterol and clenbuterol, but not the β1-adrenoceptor agonist xamoterol, mimicked the ability of \{NA\} to increase neuronal complexity. \{NA\} induced expression of a range of growth factors (BDNF, NGF-β, GDNF, FGF-2 and IL-6) in glial cells. In addition to this, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and JAK-STAT signalling pathways are implicated in \{NA\} CM-induced neuritic growth as inhibition of these pathways attenuated \{NA\} CM-induced neuritic growth. In conclusion, this study indicates a novel role for \{NA\} acting at glial β2-adrenoceptors to induce neuritic growth through the expression of soluble factors that elicit a neurotrophic action and increase neuronal complexity.

Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a redox cofactor in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has been reported to protect SH-SY5Y cells from cytotoxicity induced by rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of \{PQQ\} against rotenone injury in primary cultured midbrain neurons and in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Pre-treatment with \{PQQ\} prevented cultured midbrain neurons from rotenone-induced apoptosis, restored mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and affected microtubule depolymerization. On the other hand, intraperitoneal administration of \{PQQ\} exerted protective effects on rats that had received rotenone injection into the medial forebrain bundle through decreasing the apomorphine-evoked rotation, inhibiting neuronal loss and \{TH\} down-regulation in SNc, increasing the antioxidative ability, and regulating intracellular expressions of Ndufs1 and Ndufs 4. Silencing of Ndufs1 or Ndufs4 in cultured SH-SY5Y cells or midbrain neurons reduced the neuroprotective effects of PQQ. Overall, our results suggest that \{PQQ\} neuroprotection may be mediated by the inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as well as by the gene modulation of Ndufs1 and Ndufs4. "

In addition, we found that integrin α5β1 was activated by the administration of estradiol-2-benzoate (E2B) in striatal neurons of adult female rats. Importantly, we observed that the systemic administration of \{E2B\} into hemi-parkinsonian rat models facilitates the functional integration of grafted \{DA\} neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells into the host striatal neuronal circuit via the activation of integrin α5β1. Finally, methamphetamine-induced abnormal rotation was recovered earlier in E2B-administered rats than in rats that received other regimens.

A large number of neurotransmitters including glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are involved in the central control of gastric functions. However, the neuropeptidergic systems implicated in this process remain undetermined. Nesfatin-1 was recently identified as a neuropeptide cleaved from the N-terminal part of NEFA/nucleobindin 2 precursor (NUCB2). Central administration of this neuropeptide inhibits food consumption and gastroduodenal motility in rodents. Interestingly, the \{NTS\} and the \{DMNX\} contain a dense population of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 cell bodies. These observations led us to investigate the possible involvement of NUCB2/nesfatin-1 neurons in the brainstem neuronal pathways that modulate gastric functions. We observed an activation of \{NTS\} NUCB2/nesfatinergic neurons after gastric distention in rats. In addition, we found that several \{NTS\} NUCB2/nesfatinergic neurons were GABAergic. Finally, when fluorogold was injected at the stomach level, many retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the \{DMNX\} which were also positive for NUCB2/nesfatin-1. Taken together, these observations suggest for the first time that NUCB2/nesfatin-1 neurons of the \{NTS\} are sensitive to gastric distension and then may contribute to the satiety signal. "

However, the mechanisms behind this attenuation remain to be elucidated. This study investigated the involvement of reactive oxygen species in the spinal \{GABA\} neuron loss and reduced \{GABA\} neuron excitability in spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain in mice. The importance of spinal \{GABAergic\} inhibition in neuropathic pain was tested by examining the effects of intrathecally administered \{GABA\} receptor agonists and antagonists in \{SNL\} and naïve mice, respectively. The effects of \{SNL\} and antioxidant treatment on \{GABA\} neuron loss and functional changes were examined in transgenic GAD67-enhanced green fluorescent protein positive (EGFP+) mice. \{GABA\} receptor agonists transiently reversed mechanical hypersensitivity of the hind paw in \{SNL\} mice. On the other hand, \{GABA\} receptor antagonists made naïve mice mechanically hypersensitive. Stereological analysis showed that the numbers of enhanced green fluorescent protein positive (EGFP+) \{GABA\} neurons were significantly decreased in the lateral superficial laminae (I–II) on the ipsilateral \{L5\} spinal cord after SNL. Repeated antioxidant treatments significantly reduced the pain behaviors and prevented the reduction in EGFP+ \{GABA\} neurons. The response rate of the tonic firing \{GABA\} neurons recorded from \{SNL\} mice increased with antioxidant treatment, whereas no change was seen in those recorded from naïve mice, which suggested that oxidative stress impaired some spinal \{GABA\} neuron activity in the neuropathic pain condition. Together the data suggest that neuropathic pain, at least partially, is attributed to oxidative stress, which induces both a \{GABA\} neuron loss and dysfunction of surviving \{GABA\} neurons. "

Here we used a combination of genetic tracing and electrophysiological and immunohistochemical analyses in mice to functionally characterize the neurons in the solitary tract nuclei of the medulla, which receive input from mT2R5-expressing cells. The neurons defined by a transneuronal tracer originating from mT2R5-expressing cells receive glutamatergic synaptic input via the \{AMPA\} receptor. The satiety peptide cholecystokinin increases glutamatergic transmission, suggesting an interaction between information processing of taste and the homeostatic control of feeding. Nevertheless, the tracer-labeled neuron types are heterogeneous, and can be classified into catecholamine and pro-opiomelanocortin neurons. Our data reveal that the architectural solution in the first-order central relay that processes information from mT2R5-expressing cells uses unique ensembles of neurons with different neurotransmitters.

Using immunofluorescence of spinal cord tissue of rats from the first postnatal day (P1) until the end of the 5th postnatal week (P36), we observed that these neurons show both immature (doublecortin+, β-III-tubulin+, neurofilament 200 kDa−) and more mature (weak NeuN+, P2X2+, GAD65+) characteristics during the first postnatal weeks. Because of the gradually decreasing number of CSF-cNs in the central canal lining during development, we were also interested in the migration potential of these cells. However, the assessment of the number of CSF-cNs in the lining of the central canal during postnatal development revealed that this decline is most likely associated with the growth of the spinal cord. Lastly, to reveal the birth date of CSF-cNs, we performed 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine administration and colocalization analyses. We found that production of these cells appears from day 12 of embryonic development (E12) until E22. The vast majority of CSF-contacting neurons arise on \{E14\} and E15. In contrast with other types of spinal neurons, the production of CSF-cNs is not restricted to a particular neuroepithelial region and occurs even after what is thought to be the termination of neurogenesis.

As seen in previous \{LAEs\} with a-Si:H, the TiO2 film formed on a metal film electrode serves as a photo-switch: \{UV\} light illumination locally increases the conductivity of the TiO2 film and generates a virtual electrode. TiO2 is a lower cost material, easier to fabricate than a-Si:H, and more compatible with cell culture environments; thus, it does not require a passivation layer on top. The measurements of photoelectric characteristics of TiO2 \{LAE\} ascertained that adequate photo-switching properties for selective neuronal stimulation were achieved; however, two possible issues that could affect performance were identified: degradation of the photo-switching property due to electrolyte penetration into the TiO2 film and a slow switching response due to charge carrier trapping into surface defects. Despite these issues, however, the feasibility of light-addressed electrical stimulation with the proposed TiO2 \{LAE\} was successfully demonstrated in an experiment using a primary neuron-glia co-culture. Thus, TiO2 is an alternative candidate to a-Si:H in photo-electrochemical biointerfaces. "

Similar samples were also collected during routine post-mortem examinations from 12 aged donkeys; six animals were humanely destroyed for conditions related to the intestinal tract, while the remaining six were humanely destroyed for other reasons including dental and orthopaedic diseases. Tissue samples were fixed in formalin and immunohistochemical labelling was performed targeting the enteric neurons using a polyclonal antibody specific for the neuronal marker \{PGP\} 9.5. The distribution and density of neuronal networks were assessed qualitatively and semiquantitatively. There was strong \{PGP\} 9.5 expression in both the horse and donkey samples and labelling was detected throughout the tissue sections. In both species, \{PGP\} 9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibres were detected in all layers of the intestinal tract, both in large and small intestinal samples. Networks of enteric neurons were present in the donkey with a similar distribution to that seen in the horse. There was no demonstrable difference in enteric neuronal density and distribution in the groups of animals with intestinal disease compared with those without, apart from two (out of 28) horses with intestinal disease that showed a marked reduction in \{PGP\} 9.5 immunoreactivity. Apart from these two animals, this total cohort analysis differs from some previously observed findings in horses with intestinal disease and may therefore reflect the different pathophysiological processes occurring in varying intestinal conditions resulting in colic both in the donkey and the horse.

Cortical neurons migrate along glial scaffolds formed by radial glia guided by Reelin ligand. However, it is unclear whether the Reelin-directed behavior of radial glia is also critical for positioning the spinal neurons. Here we demonstrate a novel role of radial glia that confines motor neurons within the neural tube and is promoted by Reelin and Notch signaling. Spinal radial glia express the Dab1 adaptor for Reelin signaling and are surrounded by Reelin. In reeler mice, in which Reelin is absent, ectopic motor neurons are found outside the neural tube, although they appear to maintain their identity. Boundary cap (BC) cells, Schwann cell precursors and the basal lamina at motor exit points are intact, whereas the glia limitans of radial glia are disorganized and detached from the basement membrane. The sparse and irregular radial scaffold is wide enough to allow motor somata to pass. Forced activation of Notch signaling rescued the structural defects in radial glia in reeler mice and the appearance of extraspinal neurons. In the absence of Reelin, Notch intracellular domain (NICD) protein level was reduced. In addition, disrupting the radial glia scaffold by destroying its polarity induced ectopic motor neurons in chick embryos. These findings suggest that activation of the Notch pathways by Reelin is required to establish the radial glial scaffold, a structure that actively constrains motor neuron somata and specifies the CNS–PNS boundary.

During synaptic blockade conditions, ∼10% of respiratory neurons fired bursts of action potentials, with post-inspiratory cells (6/9) having the highest percentage of intrinsic burst properties. Most intrinsically bursting respiratory neurons were clustered at the level of the vagus (X) nerve root. Synaptic inhibition blockade caused seizure-like activity throughout the turtle brainstem, which shows that the turtle respiratory control system is not transformed into a network driven by intrinsically bursting respiratory neurons. We hypothesize that intrinsically bursting respiratory neurons are evolutionarily conserved and represent a potential rhythmogenic mechanism contributing to respiration in adult turtles. "

Accumulating evidences have indicated that synaptic transmission on the hypothalamic neurons is modulated by the metabolic condition related to fasted/fed states, and that this modulation of synaptic plasticity plays a role in regulation of feeding. It has been shown that oxytocin (Oxt) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus sense and integrate various peripheral and central signals and thereby induce satiety. However, whether metabolic conditions regulate the synaptic transmission on Oxt neurons in \{PVN\} remains unclear. The present study examined whether the fasted/fed states regulate synaptic transmission on Oxt neurons in PVN. The miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) onto Oxt neurons in \{PVN\} were increased under ad lib fed condition compared to 24 h fasted condition. Furthermore, the \{NMDA\} receptor-mediated \{EPSC\} on Oxt neurons was increased under fed, compared to fasted, condition. In Oxt neurons, dynein light chain 2 (DYNLL2), a protein suggested to be implicated in the \{NMDA\} receptor trafficking to the postsynaptic site, was increased under fed, compared to fasted, condition. The present results suggest that feeding increases excitatory synaptic input on \{PVN\} Oxt neurons via mechanisms involving \{DYNLL2\} upregulation and \{NMDA\} receptor-mediated synaptic reorganization.

We found that the expression of the nucleotide receptor \{P2Y4\} was transiently augmented in the course of neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which was after loss of pluripotency but prior to terminal differentiation of neurons. The activation of \{P2Y4\} in the differentiating \{ESCs\} resulted in an increased proportion of neurons expressing vesicular glutamate transporter (vGluT), a marker of glutamatergic subtype. A subpopulation of type 2 \{NSCs\} of the adult mouse hippocampus expressed P2Y4. Its activation induced the expression of glutamatergic subtype markers, vGluT and TBR1, in their descendant neurons. Reciprocally, inhibition of the \{P2Y4\} signaling abolished the effects of nucleotides on those expressions. Our results provide evidence that differentiating \{NSCs\} pass through a stage in which nucleotides can affect subtype marker expression of their descendant neurons. "

In the present study we examined whether palmitoylation regulates Ca2+ permeability of \{AMPA\} receptor and excitotoxicity in cultured spinal cord neurons. We adapted chronic 2-bromopalmitate (2-BrP) treatment to achieve depalmitoylation and examined its effect on the cytotoxicity in spinal cord neurons exposed to AMPA. The change in \{AMPA\} induced signaling and cytotoxicity in motor neurons and other spinal neurons under identical conditions of exposure to \{AMPA\} was studied. 2-BrP treatment inhibited \{AMPA\} induced rise in [Ca2+]i and cytotoxicity in both types of neurons but the degree of inhibition was significantly higher in motor neurons as compared to other spinal neurons. The \{AMPA\} induced [Na+]i rise was moderately affected in both type of neurons on depalmitoylation. Depalmitoylation reduced the expression levels of \{AMPA\} receptor subunits (GluR1 and GluR2) and also PSD-95 but stargazin levels remained unaffected.

Whether midazolam affects ion currents and membrane potential in neurons remains largely unclear. Electrophysiological studies of midazolam actions were performed in differentiated motor neuron-like (NSC-34 and NG108-15) cells. Midazolam suppressed the amplitude of delayed rectifier K+ current (IK(DR)) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with an \{IC50\} value of 10.4 µM. Addition of midazolam was noted to enhance the rate of IK(DR) inactivation. On the basis of minimal binding scheme, midazolam-induced block of IK(DR) was quantitatively provided with a dissociation constant of 9.8 µM. Recovery of IK(DR) from inactivation in the presence of midazolam was fitted by a single exponential. midazolam had no effect on M-type or erg-mediated K+ current in these cells. Midazaolam (30 µM) suppressed the peak amplitude of voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) with no change in the current–voltage relationships of this current. Inactivation kinetics of \{INa\} remained unaltered in the presence of this agent. In current-clamp configuration, midazolam (30 µM) prolonged the duration of action potentials (APs) and reduce \{AP\} amplitude. Similarly, in differentiated NG108-15 cells, the exposure to midazolam also suppressed IK(DR) with a concomitant increase in current inactivation. Midazolam can act as an open-channel blocker of delayed-rectifier K+ channels in these cells. The synergistic blocking effects on IK(DR) and \{INa\} may contribute to the underlying mechanisms through which midazolam affects neuronal function in vivo. "

This is in part due to the inability to obtain ample deep gastric wall biopsies that include the intermuscular layer of the muscularis propria (MP) to evaluate the enteric nervous system, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and related cells. We report on a novel technique for gastric endoscopic muscle biopsy (gEMB). Methods Patients with idiopathic gastroparesis were prospectively enrolled in a feasibility study using a novel “no hole” gEMB. Main outcome measures were technical success, adverse events and histological confirmation of the intermuscular layer, including myenteric neurons and ICC. The gEMB was a double resection clip–assist technique. A site was identified on the anterior wall of the gastric body as recommended by the International Working Group on histological techniques. Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed to unroof and expose the underlying MP. The exposed \{MP\} was then retracted into the cap of an over-the-scope clip. The clip was deployed and the pseudopolyp of \{MP\} created was resected. This resulted in a “no-hole” gEMB. Results Three patients with idiopathic gastroparesis underwent gEMB. Patients had severe delayed gastric emptying with a mean of 49 + 16.8% of retained gastric contents at 4 hours. They had no history of gastric or small-bowel surgery, and did not use steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs. The gEMB procedure was successfully performed with no procedural adverse events. Postprocedure abdominal pain was controlled with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and opioid analgesics. Mean length of resected \{MP\} was 10.3 + 1.5 mm. Mean procedure time was 25.7 + 6 minutes. Tissue samples on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain confirmed presence of both inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle as well as the intermuscular layer. H&amp;E stain showed reduced myenteric ganglia in 1 patient. In 2 patients, specialized immunohistochemistry was performed, which showed marked decrease in myenteric neurons as delineated by an antibody to Protein Gene Product (PGP) 9.5 and severe decrease in \{ICC\} across the muscle layers. At 1 month follow-up, upper endoscopy showed a well-healed scar in 2 patients and minimal ulceration with retained clip in 1 patient. \{CT\} abdomen confirmed the integrity of the gastric wall in all patients. Due to lack of an immune infiltrate in the resected samples, patients were not considered suitable for immunosuppressive or steroid therapy. Conclusions gEMB is feasible and easy to perform, with acquisition of tissue close to surgical samples to identify myenteric ganglia, \{ICC\} and multiple cell types. The ability to perform gEMB represents a paradigm shift in endoscopic tissue diagnosis of gastric neuromuscular pathologies. "

We have analysed the Hodgkin Huxley type conductance based Fast spiking neuron model as electrical circuit by changing the frequency and amplitude of the applied electric field. The study has shown that, the presence of electric field increases the membrane potential, electrical energy supply and metabolic energy consumption. As the amplitude of applied electric field increases by keeping a constant frequency, the membrane potential increases and consequently the electrical energy supply and metabolic energy consumption increases. On increasing the frequency of the applied field, the peak value of membrane potential after depolarization gradually decreases as a result electrical energy supply decreases which results in a lower rate of hydrolysis of \{ATP\} molecules.

Our understanding of the function of class I/II bHLH transcription factors in both invertebrate and vertebrate neurobiology is largely focused on their function as regulators of neurogenesis. Here, we show that the class I bHLH proteins Daughterless and Tcf4 are expressed in postmitotic neurons in Drosophila melanogaster and mice, respectively, where they function to restrict neurite branching and synapse formation.

Synaptic vesicle recycling in and neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic nerve terminals are altered when a glutamate-deleting mutation is present in the torsinA protein (ΔE-torsinA). This mutation is linked with a hereditary form of the movement disorder dystonia known as \{DYT1\} dystonia. Although torsinA expression is prevalent throughout the central nervous system, its subcellular localization – in particular with respect to presynaptic nerve terminals – remains unclear. This information would be useful in narrowing down possible models for how wild-type torsinA affects presynaptic function, as well as the nature of the presynaptic dysfunction that arises in the context of ΔE-torsinA mutation. Here we report on an analysis of the presynaptic localization of torsinA in cultured neurons obtained from a knock-in mouse model of \{DYT1\} dystonia. Primary cultures of neurons were established from heterozygous and homozygous ΔE-torsinA knock-in mice, as well as from their wild-type littermates. Neurons were obtained from the striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of these mice, and were subjected to immunocytochemistry. This analysis revealed the expression of both proteins in the somata and dendrites. However, neither the nerve terminals nor axonal shafts were immunoreactive. These results were confirmed by fluorogram-based quantitation. Our findings indicate that neither the wild-type nor the ΔE-torsinA mutant protein is present at substantial levels in the presynaptic structures of cultured neurons. Thus, the effects of torsinA, in wild-type and mutant forms, appear to influence presynaptic function indirectly, without residing in presynaptic structures. "

Both types of neurons contribute to increased alveolar ventilation. Decreases in intracellular pH are thought to link the rise in [CO2] to increased ventilation. Because electroneutral Na+-coupled \{HCO\} 3 - transporters (nNCBTs), which help protect cells from intracellular acidosis, are expressed robustly in the neurons of the central nervous system, a key question is whether these transporters are present in chemosensitive neurons. Therefore, we used an immunocytochemistry approach to identify neurons (using a microtubule associated protein-2 monoclonal antibody) and specifically 5HT neurons (TPH monoclonal antibody) or \{GABAergic\} neurons (GAD2 monoclonal antibody) in freshly dissociated cells from the mouse MR. We also co-labeled with polyclonal antibodies against the three nNCBTs: NBCn1, NDCBE, and NBCn2. We exploited ePet-EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) mice (with EYFP-labeled 5HT neurons) as well as mice genetically deficient in each of the three nNCBTs. Quantitative image analysis distinguished positively stained cells from background signals. We found that &gt;80% of GAD2+ cells also were positive for NDCBE, and &gt;90% of the TPH+ and GAD2+ cells were positive for the other nNCBTs. Assuming that the transporters are independently distributed among neurons, we can conclude that virtually all chemosensitive \{MR\} neurons contain at least one nNCBT. "

This dendrite extends upward from somas of pyramidal neurons, the most numerous neurons of the cortex. The apical dendrite is embedded in a recurrent corticothalamic circuit that induces surges of electric current to move repeatedly down the dendrite. Narrow bandwidths of surge frequency (resonating) enable cortical circuits to use specific carrier frequencies, which isolate the processing of those circuits from other circuits. Resonating greatly enhances the intensity and duration of electrical activity of a neuron over a narrow frequency range, which underlies attention in its various modes. Within the minicolumn, separation of the central resonating circuit from the surrounding signal processing network separates “having” subjective impressions from “thinking about” them. Resonating neurons in the insular cortex apparently underlie cognitive impressions of feelings. "

Also, to determine the hippocampal neurogenesis rate, the rats were administered bromodeoxyuridine along with the \{PRL\} treatment. Immunostaining for NeuN revealed that neuronal loss is lower in the \{CA1\} of PRL-treated rats compared with the untreated group, but \{PRL\} did not confer any protection in the \{CA3\} and \{CA4\} subfields. Furthermore, \{PRL\} prevented the KA-induced cognitive deficit measured as a better performance in the novel object recognition test. The \{PRL\} treatment did not modify the neurogenesis rate. These data indicate that post-treatment with \{PRL\} confers differential neuroprotection against KA-induced neuronal loss in hippocampal subfield CA1, which correlates with a more mild cognitive deficit compared with the untreated control group.

Although speech understanding in background noise is quite difficult for those with presbycusis, there are currently no biomedical treatments to prevent, delay or reverse this condition. A better understanding of the cochlear mechanisms underlying presbycusis will help lead to future treatments. Objectives of the present study were to investigate \{GABAA\} receptor subunit α1, nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor subunit β2, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit \{NR1\} mRNA and protein expression changes in spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) of the CBA/CaJ mouse cochlea, that occur in age-related hearing loss, utilizing quantitative immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. We found that auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds shifted over 40 dB from 3 to 48 kHz in old mice compared to young adults. \{DPOAE\} thresholds also shifted over 40 dB from 6 to 49 kHz in old mice, and their amplitudes were significantly decreased or absent in the same frequency range. \{SGN\} density decreased with age in basal, middle and apical turns, and \{SGN\} density of the basal turn declined the most. A positive correlation was observed between \{SGN\} density and \{ABR\} wave 1 amplitude. mRNA and protein expression of \{GABAAR\} α1 and \{AChR\} β2 decreased with age in \{SGNs\} in the old mouse cochlea. mRNA and protein expression of \{NMDAR\} \{NR1\} increased with age in \{SGNs\} of the old mice. These findings demonstrate that there are functionally-relevant age-related changes of GABAAR, nAChR, \{NMDAR\} expression in \{CBA\} mouse \{SGNs\} reflecting their degeneration, which may be related to functional changes in cochlear synaptic transmission with age, suggesting biological mechanisms for peripheral age-related hearing loss.

A recent study has shown evidence of functional recovery after transplantation of the stem cells into a degenerated-SGN model. Chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, or known as \{CXC\} chemokine ligand-12, CXCL-12) signaling through \{CXCR4\} has previously been identified as a key step in the homing of the stem cells within the injury areas; meanwhile, studies have revealed that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is also involved in axon guidance and pathfinding. A study found that transplanted neural precursor cells can migrate to the root of the auditory nerve when animals are subjected to an augmented acoustic environment (AAE). In accordance with these studies, we hypothesize that \{AAE\} will up-regulate the expression of SDF-1 in acoustic nerves. We tested our hypothesis by examining the expression of SDF-1 in different acoustic environments, and the results were confirmed by the auditory brainstem response (ABR), immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses. The results showed that SDF-1 was expressed at a relatively low level in the \{SGNs\} under normal animal unit acoustic conditions (40–50 dB). Moreover, it was significantly up-regulated in the \{SGNs\} under the 75 dB (augmented physiological process without hearing loss) and 90 dB \{AAE\} (pathological process with light hearing loss) conditions; however, under the 115 dB \{AAE\} (pathological process with severe hearing loss) condition, the expression of SDF-1 was not up-regulated. The results confirmed that appropriately augmented acoustical stimuli lead to the up-regulation of SDF-1, which may assist in the migration of the transplanted cells and the subsequent establishment of essential synaptic contacts between the exogenous cells and the host auditory pathway.

Namely, the neuron learns to be more prone to generate spikes given those combinations of firing input neurons for which a previous spiking of the neuron had been followed by a positive global reward signal. The reward signal may be mediated by certain modulatory hormones or neurotransmitters, e.g., the dopamine. More generally, a trial-and-error learning paradigm is suggested in which a global reward signal triggers long-term enhancement or weakening of a neuron’s spiking response to the preceding neuronal input firing pattern. Thus, rewards provide a feedback pathway that informs neurons whether their spiking was beneficial or detrimental for a particular input combination. The neuron’s ability to discern specific combinations of firing input neurons is achieved through a random or predetermined spatial distribution of input synapses on dendrites that creates synaptic clusters that represent various permutations of input neurons. The corresponding dendritic segments, or the enclosed individual spines, are capable of being particularly excited, due to local sigmoidal thresholding involving voltage-gated channel conductances, if the segment’s excitatory and absence of inhibitory inputs are temporally coincident. Such nonlinear excitation corresponds to a particular firing combination of input neurons, and it is posited that the excitation strength encodes the combinatorial memory and is regulated by long-term plasticity mechanisms. It is also suggested that the spine calcium influx that may result from the spatiotemporal synaptic input coincidence may cause the spine head actin filaments to undergo mechanical (muscle-like) contraction, with the ensuing cytoskeletal deformation transmitted to the axon initial segment where it may modulate the global neuron firing threshold. The tasks of pattern classification and generalization are discussed within the presented framework. "

Based on this dual characteristic mu suppression is thought to signalize activation of a human analogue of the mirror neuron system (MNS) found in macaque monkeys. However, much uncertainty remains concerning its specificity and full significance. To further explore the hypothesized relationship between mu suppression and \{MNS\} activation, we investigated how it is affected by damage to cortical regions, including areas where the \{MNS\} is thought to reside. \{EEG\} was recorded in 33 first-event stroke patients during observation of video clips showing reaching and grasping hand movements. We examined the modulation of \{EEG\} oscillations at central and occipital sites, and analyzed separately the lower (8-10 Hz) and higher (10-12 Hz) segments of the alpha/mu range. Suppression was determined relative to observation of a non-biological movement. Normalized lesion data were used to investigate how damage to regions of the fronto-parietal cortex affects the pattern of suppression. The magnitude of mu suppression during action observation was significantly reduced in the affected hemisphere compared to the unaffected hemisphere. Differences between the hemispheres were significant at central (sensorimotor) sites but not at occipital (visual) sites. Total hemispheric volume loss did not correlate with mu suppression. Suppression in the lower mu range in the unaffected hemisphere (C3) correlated with lesion extent within the right inferior parietal cortex. Our lesion study supports the role of mu suppression as a marker of \{MNS\} activation, confirming previous studies in normal subjects. "

Here we recorded the spiking activity of receptor neurons (RNs) and mitral/tufted cells (MCs) in the frog olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb respectively, in response to four odorants applied at precisely controlled concentrations. We compared how \{RN\} responses are translated in MCs. We examined the time course of the instantaneous firing frequency before and after stimulation in neuron ensembles and the dependency on odorant concentration of the number of action potentials fired in a preselected 5-s time window (dose–response curves) in both single neurons and neuron ensembles. In \{RNs\} and MCs, the dose–response curves typically increase then decrease and are well described by alpha functions. We established the main quantitative properties of these curves, including the distributions of concentrations at threshold and maximum responses. We showed that the main transformations occurring in the transition from \{RNs\} to \{MCs\} is the lowering of the firing threshold and a large decrease in the total number of spikes fired. We also found that the number of action potentials fired by recorded neurons and hence their energy consumption is independent of odorant concentration, and that this is a consequence of their time- and concentration-dependent activities.

Their ability to sense tissue ischaemia is assumed to be primarily mediated through proton sensing ion channels, lack of oxygen however may also affect sensory neuron function. In this study we investigated the effects of anoxia on isolated capsaicin sensitive neurons from rat nodose ganglion. Acute anoxia triggered a reversible increase in [Ca2+]i that was mainly due to Ca2+-efflux from \{FCCP\} sensitive stores and from caffeine and \{CPA\} sensitive \{ER\} stores. Prolonged anoxia resulted in complete depletion of \{ER\} Ca2+-stores. Mitochondria were partially depolarised by acute anoxia but mitochondrial Ca2+-uptake/buffering during voltage-gated Ca2+-influx was unaffected. The process of Ca2+-release from mitochondria and cytosolic Ca2+-clearance following Ca2+ influx was however significantly slowed. Anoxia was also found to inhibit \{SERCA\} activity and, to a lesser extent, \{PMCA\} activity. Hence, anoxia has multiple influences on [Ca2+]i homeostasis in vagal afferent neurons, including depression of ATP-driven Ca2+-pumps, modulation of the kinetics of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering/release and Ca2+-release from, and depletion of, internal Ca2+-stores. These effects are likely to influence sensory neuronal function during ischaemia. "

Functional impairment in the mirror neuron system which is involved in both motor execution and imitation may be a neural basis of blunted affect, but it is not proved yet. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls performed the facial expression task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task was to reproduce facial expressions in response to the face or word stimuli for happiness, sadness, and meaningless expression. Brain activities during facial expressions in patients compared with controls and their relationship with affective flattening were analyzed. Compared to controls, patients exhibited decreased activity in the widespread dorsal frontal regions and increased activity in the ventral frontal and subcortical regions. Patients also demonstrated significant negative correlation of the severity of affective flattening with activities in the mirror neuron system, such as the premotor cortex, motor cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Emotional expression in patients with schizophrenia may be related to hypoactivity of the dorsal system and hyperactivity of the ventral system. An imbalance of these two systems may contribute to blunted affect. Directly addressing blunted affect using emotional expression provides a new perspective that functional disturbance of the mirror neuron system may play an important role in manifestation of blunted affect in schizophrenia.

Here, we demonstrate that vangl2 functions largely in floor plate cells to regulate caudal neuronal migration. Furthermore, \{FBM\} neurons fail to migrate caudally in the mouse Gli2 mutant that lacks the floor plate, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for this cell type in neuronal migration. Although hindbrain floor plate cilia are disorganized in vangl2 mutant embryos, cilia appear to be dispensable for neuronal migration. Notably, Vangl2 is enriched in the basolateral, but not apical, membranes of floor plate cells. Taken together, our data suggest strongly that Vangl2 regulates \{FBM\} neuron migration by acting in floor plate cells, independently of cilia function. "

In this paper, formation and development of spiral wave in a regular network of Morris–Lecar neurons, which neurons are placed on nodes uniformly in a two-dimensional array and each node is coupled with nearest-neighbor type, are investigated by considering the effect of stochastic ion channels poisoning and channel noise. The formation and selection of spiral wave could be detected as follows. (1) External forcing currents with diversity are imposed on neurons in the network of excitatory neurons with nearest-neighbor connection, a target-like wave emerges and its potential mechanism is discussed; (2) artificial defects and local poisoned area are selected in the network to induce new wave to interact with the target wave; (3) spiral wave can be induced to occupy the network when the target wave is blocked by the artificial defects or poisoned area with regular border lines; (4) the stochastic poisoning effect is introduced by randomly modifying the border lines (areas) of specific regions in the network. It is found that spiral wave can be also developed to occupy the network under appropriate poisoning ratio. The process of growth for the poisoned area of ion channels poisoning is measured, the effect of channels noise is also investigated. It is confirmed that perfect spiral wave emerges in the network under gradient poisoning even if the channel noise is considered. "

In most of the analyzed spines, it was found that its length considerably exceeded that reported in mammals, with dendritic spines up to 8 μm in length.

The dendritic spines on these cells contain glutamatergic synaptic contacts between the cortex (or the thalamus) and the striatum. The complexity of the dendritic structure of \{MSNs\} may therefore reflect the functional status of the basal ganglia because the striatum is the major input structure in which signals from different regions are integrated. We examined the structural alterations in the dendrites of striatal \{MSNs\} in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Acute \{MPTP\} treatment rapidly damaged dopaminergic neurons and their terminals within the striatum and caused behavioral impairments. However, mice injected with \{MPTP\} spontaneously recovered from these behavioral impairments within one week. This recovery was accompanied by the restoration of dendritic structures on MSNs, but the damage to dopaminergic neurons remained extensive. Furthermore, we demonstrated that rasagiline, a monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor that has been shown to be efficacious for PD, could enhance the dendritic complexity of cultured MSNs. The effect of rasagiline on the spine-like structures of dendrites, however, appears not to require \{DA\} availability because the small protrusions of dendrites in cultured \{MSNs\} without major source of \{DA\} input was similarly changed by rasagiline. Our data suggest that the dendritic structures of striatal \{MSNs\} change dynamically, reflecting the progression of motor-related symptoms in PD, and the restoration of functional synapses in the \{MSNs\} of \{PD\} patients may constitute a clinical target for symptomatic alleviation.

However, developmental changes in \{INaP\} properties remain largely unclear. In the present study using whole cell patch clamp technique we evaluated \{INaP\} properties in \{CA1\} hippocampal pyramidal neurons isolated from young (postnatal day (P) 12–16) and adult (P60-75) rats. We show that the \{INaP\} density is substantially larger in the adult group. Although \{INaP\} inactivation characteristics were found to be similar in both groups, voltage dependence of \{INaP\} activation is shifted to more negative membrane potentials (young: −48.6 ± 0.5 mV vs. adult: −52.4 ± 0.2 mV, p &lt; 0.01). Our data indicates the increase of \{INaP\} contribution in the basal membrane sodium conductivity in the mature hippocampus. "

Aims To give an overview about publications during the last year concerning the genetic background and phenotypic manifestations of MNDs, such as familial or sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS, sALS), spinal muscular atrophies (SMA), bulbospinal muscular atrophy (BSMA), and unclassified MNDs. Methods Pubmed search for literature about ALS, SMA, and \{BSMA\} for the period 10/2012 to 9/2013. Results An increasing number of mutated genes is recognised in fALS but also sALS patients. Genes mutated in sALS include C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, UBQL2, SQSTM1, DCTN1, and UNC13A. Juvenile (onset &lt;20 y) and adult \{ALS\} (early onset 20–60 y, late onset &gt;60 y) are differentiated. Juvenile fALS is most frequently caused by mutations in ALS2, SETX, spatacsin, or Sigmar1 and adult fALS by mutations in C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, and FUS. Onset, phenotype, progression, and outcome of \{ALS\} are variable between different mutations, different genes, and different countries. Differentiation between sALS and fALS cases becomes artificial. Conclusions Further progress has been made over the last year in the clarification and understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of MNDs. However, further effort is needed to answer the many remaining questions. "

The toxicity of BoNT/A is due to the inhibition of neurotransmission at cholinergic synapses; this is responsible for the symptom of flaccid paralysis at peripheral neuromuscular junctions. At a molecular level, the BoNT/A effect is due to its inhibition of stimulated acetylcholine (ACh) release from presynaptic nerve terminals. Currently, there is no antidote available to rescue BoNT/A-poisoned synapses. Here, we report an example of rescuing botulinum-poisoned cultured mouse spinal cord neurons by treatment with Mastoparan-7 (Mas-7), which is known to be a phospholipase \{A2\} activator compound. Mas-7, a naturally occurring bee venom peptide, was delivered to botulinum-poisoned neurons via a drug delivery vehicle (DDV) construct prepared using the recombinant non-toxic heavy chain (HC) fragment of BoNT/A itself. In this method, the BoNT/A \{HC\} component in the \{DDV\} served as a neuron specific drug targeting molecule. We found that Mas-7 delivered into BoNT/A intoxicated spinal cord cells restored over 40% their property of stimulated neurotransmitter release. Rescue from cell poisoning did not occur from inhibition of the endopeptidase activity of BoNT/A light chain (LC) against its well-known substrate, SNAP-25 that is mechanistically involved in the cholinergic neuroexocytosis process. Rather, Mas-7 induced a physiological host response apparently unrelated to SNAP-25, but linked to the phospholipase-mediated signal transduction pathway. "

Morphological and neurochemical characteristics of labeled cardiac spinal afferent neurons were assessed in young (2 months) and old (2 years) rats using markers for likely unmyelinated (isolectin B4; IB4) and myelinated (neurofilament 200; N52) neurons. The number of cardiac spinal afferent neurons decreased in senescence to 15% of that found in young rats (1604 vs. 248). The size of neuronal soma as well as proportion of \{IB4\} + neurons increased significantly, whereas the proportion of \{N52\} + neurons decreased significantly in senescence. Unlike somatic spinal afferents, neurochemically different populations of cardiac spinal afferent neurons experience morphological and neurochemical changes related to aging. A major decrease in total number of cardiac spinal afferent neurons occurs in senescence. The proportion of \{N52\} + neurons decreased in senescence, but it seems that nociceptive innervation is preserved due to increased proportion and size of \{IB4\} + unmyelinated neurons. "

In the present study we investigated whether prenatal exposure to bisphenol A disturbs the neurodevelopment of the cerebellum. Two different model systems were used; offspring from two strains of mice from mothers receiving bisphenol A in the drinking water before mating, during gestation and lactation, and chicken embryos exposed to bisphenol A (in the egg) on embryonic day 16 for 24 h before preparation of cerebellar granule cell cultures. In the cerebellum, tight regulation of the level of transcription factor Pax6 is critical for correct development of granule neurons. During the development, the Pax6 level in granule neurons is high when these cells are located in the external granule layer and during their migration to the internal granule layer, and it is then reduced. We report that bisphenol A induced an increase in the thickness of the external granule layer and also an increase in the total cerebellar Pax6 level in 11 days old mice offspring. In cultured chicken cerebellar granule neurons from bisphenol A injected eggs the Pax6 level was increased day 6 in vitro. Together, these findings indicate that bisphenol A may affect the granule neurons in the developing cerebellum and thereby may disturb the correct development of the cerebellum. "

To improve simplicity and efficiency, we tested an imaging method of the cochlea, and based on Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), we visualised Rosenthal's Canal and quantified the spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) within. Cochleae of 8 normal hearing guinea pigs and one implanted with a silicone filament were fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA), decalcified, dehydrated and cleared in Spalteholz solution. Using the tissue's autofluorescence, \{CLSM\} was performed at 100fold magnification generating z-series stacks of about 20 slices of the modiolus. In 5 midmodiolar slices per cochlea the perimeters of the Rosenthal's Canal were surveyed, representative neuron diameters were measured and the neurons first counted manually and then software-assisted. For comparison, 8 normal hearing guinea pig cochleae were embedded in paraffin and examined similarly. The \{CLSM\} method has the advantage that the cochleae remain intact as an organ and keep their geometrical structure. Z-stack creation is nearly fully-automatic and frequently repeatable with various objectives and step sizes and without visible bleaching. The tissue shows minimal or no shrinking artefacts and damage typical of embedding and sectioning. As a result, the cells in the cleared cochleae reach an average diameter of 21 μm and a density of about 18 cells/10,000 μm2 with no significant difference between the manual and the automatical counts. Subsequently we compared the \{CLSM\} data with those generated using the established method of paraffin slides, where the \{SGN\} reached a mean density of 9.5 cells/10,000 μm2 and a mean soma diameter of 13.6 μm. We were able to prove that the semi-automatic \{CLSM\} method is a simple and effective technique for auditory neuron count. It provides a high grade of tissue preservation and the automatic stack-generation as well as the counter software reduces the effort considerably. In addition this visualisation technique offers the potential to detect the position and orientation of cochlear implants (CI) within the cochlea and tissue growing in the scala tympani around the \{CI\} and at the position of the cochleostomy due to the fact that the implant does not have to be removed to perform histology as in case of the paraffin method.

In sensory neurons, TRPV1–V4, \{TRPA1\} and \{TRPM8\} are expressed and are responsible for the conversion of external stimuli to painful sensations. Under pathophysiological conditions, excessive activity of TRP-channels leads to mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Among the endogenous TRP-channel sensitizers, activators and inhibitors, more than 50 arachidonic acid- and linoleic acid-metabolites from the COX-, LOX- and CYP-pathways, as well as lysophospholipids and isoprenoids can be found. As a consequence, these lipids represent the vast majority of endogenous TRP-channel modulators in sensory neurons. Although the precise mechanisms of TRP-channel modulation by most lipids are still unknown, it became clear that lipids can either bind directly to the target TRP-channel or modulate TRP-channels indirectly by activating G-protein coupled receptors. Thus, TRP-channels seem to be key sensors for lipids, integrating and interpreting incoming signals from the different metabolic lipid pathways. Here, we discuss the specific properties of the currently known endogenous lipid-derived TRP-channel modulators concerning their ability to activate or inhibit TRP-channels, the molecular mechanisms of lipid/TRP-channel interactions and specific TRP-regulatory characteristics of the individual lipid families.

This study aims to elucidate the effect of \{PGD2\} on neuronal cell death and its underlying mechanisms. \{PGD2\} dose-dependently induced cell death in rat primary neuron-enriched cultures in concentrations of ≥10 μM, and this effect was not reversed by treatment with either \{DP1\} or \{DP2\} receptor antagonists. Antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione which contain sulfhydryl groups that can bind to CyPGs, but not ascorbate or tocopherol, attenuated PGD2-induced cell death. Conversion of \{PGD2\} to CyPGs was detected in neuronal culture medium; treatment with these CyPG metabolites alone exhibited effects similar to those of PGD2, including apoptotic neuronal cell death and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Disruption of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) protected neurons against hypoxia. These results support the hypothesis that \{PGD2\} elicits its cytotoxic effects through its bioactive CyPG metabolites rather than \{DP\} receptor activation in primary neuronal culture. "

At the same time motor neurons are susceptible to \{AMPA\} receptor mediated excitotoxicity and internal calcium deregulation which is not fully understood. We analysed \{ER\} mitochondria calcium cycle (ERMCC) dynamics with subsecond resolution in \{G93A\} hSOD1 overexpressing motor neurons as a model of \{ALS\} using fluorescent calcium imaging. When comparing vulnerable motor neurons and non-motor neurons from \{G93A\} hSOD1 mice and their non-transgenic littermates, we found a decelerated cytosolic calcium clearance in the presence of \{G93A\} hSOD1. While both non-transgenic as well as \{G93A\} hSOD1 motor neurons displayed large mitochondrial calcium uptake by the mitochondrial uniporter (mUP), the mitochondrial calcium extrusion system was altered in the presence of \{G93A\} hSOD1. In addition, \{ER\} calcium uptake by the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum \{ATPase\} (SERCA) was increased in \{G93A\} hSOD1 motor neurons. In survival assays, blocking the mitochondrial sodium calcium exchanger (mNCE) by \{CGP37157\} as well as inhibiting \{SERCA\} by cyclopiazonic acid showed protective effects against kainate induced excitotoxicity. Thus, our study shows for the first time that the functional consequence of \{G93A\} hSOD1 overexpression in intact motor neurons is indeed a disturbance of the \{ER\} mitochondria calcium cycle, and identified two promising targets for therapeutic intervention in the pathology of ALS.

They were heterogeneous, including numerous juxtaglomerular neurons, granule cells, small to medium-sized neurons in the external plexiform layer (EPL), and a few small cells in the ependymal/subependymal layer. Calretinin and/or tyrosine hydroxylase occasionally colocalized in SCGN-positive juxtaglomerular neurons. Calretinin also frequently colocalized in SCGN-positive \{EPL\} and \{GCL\} neurons. Morphologically some of juxtaglomerular SCGN-positive neurons were classical periglomerular cells, whereas others were apparently different from those periglomerular cells, although they were further heterogeneous. Some extended one slender process into a glomerulus which passed the glomerulus and further penetrated into another nearby glomeruli, and thus their dendritic processes spanned two or three or more glomeruli. We named this type of juxtaglomerular neurons “transglomerular cells.” With the stereological analysis we estimated total number of juxtaglomerular SCGN-positive neurons at about 80,000/single MOB. The present study revealed the diversity of SCGN-positive neurons in the mouse \{MOB\} and their particular structural properties hitherto unknown. "

In addition, \{CCR7\} immunoreactivity was newly expressed in astrocytes, not microglia, in the ischemic \{CA1\} region from 5 days post-ischemia. However, we did not observe this finding in the ischemic CA2/3 region. Furthermore, \{CCR7\} protein levels in the ischemic \{CA1\} region were changed like the change pattern of its immunoreactivity. These results indicate that both \{CCR7\} immunoreactivity and protein levels are distinctively altered only in the \{CA1\} region after transient cerebral ischemia and that the changes in \{CCR7\} expression may be related to the ischemia-induced delayed neuronal death.

abstract = "Abstract Organic cation transporters (OCTs) are expressed mainly in the kidney and liver. \{OCTs\} transport intrinsic organic cations, including monoamine, dopamine, serotonine and choline, across the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that \{OCT2\} (SLC22A2) is expressed in cholinergic neurons, motoneurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and is implicated in acetylcholine (Ach) recycling in presynaptic terminals. Application of rabbit anti-peptide antibody revealed that \{OCT2\} was expressed in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Double immunostaining of muscle sections with anti-OCT2 and alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX) revealed that \{OCT2\} was localized in the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that \{OCT2\} was localized both in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in presynaptic terminals around the motoneurons (C-terminals) and in \{SVs\} in nerve terminals in NMJs. The similarity in the distribution of \{OCT2\} in cholinergic neurons and that of vesicular acetyl choline transporter (VAchT), and the fact that \{OCT2\} can transport choline suggest that \{OCT2\} could work as a low-affinity and high-capacity choline transporter at presynaptic terminals in cholinergic neurons in a firing-dependent manner.

Since central opioid systems may regulate feeding behavior, we examined the role of μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the hunger center, in feeding behavior of mice. Non-selective (naloxone; 3 mg/kg, s.c.) and selective μ- (β-funaltrexamine, β-FNA; 10 mg/kg, s.c.), δ- (naltrindole; 3 mg/kg, s.c.) and κ- (norbinaltorphimine, norBNI; 20 mg/kg, s.c.) opioid receptor antagonists significantly decreased food intake in food-deprived mice. The injection of naloxone (20 μg/side) into the \{LH\} significantly decreased food intake whereas the injection of naloxone (20 μg/side) outside of the \{LH\} did not affect food intake. The injection of β-FNA (2 μg/side), naltrindole (1 μg/side) or norBNI (2 μg/side) into the \{LH\} significantly decreased food intake. Furthermore, all these antagonists significantly decreased the mRNA level of preproorexin, but not those of other hypothalamic neuropeptides. In addition, the injection of the \{GABAA\} receptor agonist muscimol (5 μg/side) into the \{LH\} significantly decreased food intake, and this effect was abolished by the \{GABAA\} receptor antagonist bicuculline (50 μg/side). Muscimol (1 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the mRNA level of preproorexin in the hypothalamus. Naloxone (3 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly increased the \{GABA\} level in the \{LH\} and both bicuculline and the \{GABA\} release inhibitor 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MP, 5 μg/side) attenuated the inhibitory effect of naloxone on feeding behavior. 3-MP also attenuated the effects of β-FNA and norBNI, but not that of naltrindole. These results show that opioid systems in the \{LH\} regulate feeding behavior through orexin neurons. Moreover, μ- and κ-, but not δ-, opioid receptor antagonists inhibit feeding behavior by activating \{GABA\} neurons in the LH. "

Here, cultured dopaminergic neurons from ventral mesencephalon of mouse were exposed to N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), and the effects of \{VNP\} on the neurotoxicity of MPP+ were investigated. As a result, MPP+ caused injuries in the dopaminergic neurons. \{VNP\} significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of MPP+ by increasing axon number and length of dopaminergic neurons, and by enhancing the cell viability. Also, the MPP+-induced depolymerization of β-Tubulin \{III\} was attenuated by the treatment of VNP. In addition, \{VNP\} significantly increased the intracellular levels of cGMP. These effects of \{VNP\} were mimicked by 8-br-cGMP (a cell-permeable analog of cGMP), whereas inhibited by HS-142-1 (the antagonist of the particulate guanylyl cyclase-coupled natriuretic peptide receptors), or KT-5823 (a cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor). Taken together, \{VNP\} attenuates the neurotoxicity of MPP+ via guanylyl cyclase-coupled NPR/cGMP/PKG pathway, indicating that \{VNP\} might be a new effective reagent in the treatment of neuron degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD).

The results showed that a single administration of Res (30 mg/kg, i.p.) at 1 or 4 h, but not at 24 h before focal cerebral ischemia exerted significant neuroprotective effects, including a reduction in hippocampal \{CA1\} neuronal death and spatial cognition deficits caused by ischemia. The neuroprotective effects of Res were suppressed by pretreatment with MK801, an \{NMDA\} receptor blocker, or U0126, an extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) kinase inhibitor. A western blot analysis revealed that Res treatment at 1 h before ischemia significantly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the \{CA1\} region of the hippocampus, which can be prevented with \{U0126\} pretreatment.

We investigated if scratching differentially affects neurons depending on whether they are activated by itchy vs. painful stimuli, and if the degree of inhibition depends on the relative location of scratching. We recorded from rat lumbar dorsal horn neurons responsive to intradermal (id) microinjection of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). During the response to 5-HT, scratch stimuli (3 mm, 300 mN, 2 Hz, 20 s) were delivered at the injection site within the mechanosensitive receptive field (on-site), or 4–30 mm away, outside of the receptive field (off-site). During off-site scratching, 5-HT-evoked firing was significantly attenuated followed by recovery. On-site scratching excited neurons, followed by a significant post-scratch decrease in 5-HT-evoked firing. Most neurons additionally responded to mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate). Off-site scratching had no effect, while on-site scratching excited the neurons. These results indicate that scratching exerts a state-dependent inhibitory effect on responses of spinal neurons to pruritic but not algesic stimuli. Moreover, on-site scratching first excited neurons followed by inhibition, while off-site scratching immediately evoked the inhibition of pruritogen-evoked activity. This accounts for the suppression of itch by scratching at a distance from the site of the itchy stimulus. "

At first, the transplantation of myelinogenic cells, Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes was suggested, but the considerable technical difficulties, (poor availability, difficulties in harvesting and culturing, and the problem of rejection in the event of non-autologous sources), shifted attention towards more versatile cellular types, such as Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs). Recent studies have already demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that glially-primed \{MSCs\} (through exposure to chemical cocktails) have myelogenic abilities. In spite of a large number of papers on glially-differentiated MSCs, little is known about the ability of undifferentiated \{MSCs\} to myelinate axons and processes. Here we have demonstrated that also undifferentiated \{MSCs\} have the ability to myelinate, since they induce the myelination of rat \{DRG\} neuron processes after direct co-culturing. In this process a pivotal role is performed by the p75 receptor. "

However, the neurophysiological substrates of memory deficits occurring in the absence of Arc/Arg3.1 are unknown. We compared hippocampal \{CA1\} single-unit and local field potential (LFP) activity in Arc/Arg3.1 knockout and wild-type mice during track running and flanking sleep periods. Locomotor activity, basic firing and spatial coding properties of \{CA1\} cells in knockout mice were not different from wild-type mice. During active behavior, however, knockout animals showed a significantly shifted balance in \{LFP\} power, with a relative loss in high-frequency (beta-2 and gamma) bands compared to low-frequency bands. Moreover, during track-running, knockout mice showed a decrease in phase locking of spiking activity to \{LFP\} oscillations in theta, beta and gamma bands. Sleep architecture in knockout mice was not grossly abnormal. Sharp-wave ripples, which have been associated with memory consolidation and replay, showed only minor differences in dynamics and amplitude. Altogether, these findings suggest that Arc/Arg3.1 effects on memory formation are not only manifested at the level of molecular pathways regulating synaptic plasticity, but also at the systems level. The disrupted power balance in theta, beta and gamma rhythmicity and concomitant loss of spike-field phase locking may affect memory encoding during initial storage and memory consolidation stages. "

We employed primary hippocampal cultures to explore the modulatory effect of \{CCK\} on CCK+ neurons. CCK-8S (0.2 μM) was added to the culture medium from day in vitro 2 (DIV-2) to DIV-11. An adenovirus integrated with the \{CCK\} promoter was used to label CCK+ neurons. Whole-cell patch clamp recording was carried on to record the electrophysiology properties. The results show that: (1) CCK-8S significantly decreased membrane capacity but increased the membrane resistance (Rm) of CCK+ neurons, (2) CCK-8S increased action potential (AP) firing frequency of CCK+ neurons but did not affect the firing pattern, (3) CCK-8S facilitated CCK+ neuron excitatory synaptic transmission but attenuated inhibitory synaptic transmission, and (4) the expression of postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) in cultured hippocampal neurons was elevated by CCK-8S treatment. Our results demonstrate that CCK-8S significantly alters the membrane electrophysiological characteristics and synaptic activity of cultured hippocampal CCK+ neurons.

In chronically infected individuals, the parasite resides primarily in cysts within neurons in the central nervous system. The chronic infection in immunocompetent individuals has been considered to be asymptomatic but increasing evidence indicates the chronic infection can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia, prenatal depression and suicidal thoughts. A better understanding of the mechanism(s) by which the parasite exerts effects on human behavior is limited due to lack of suitable human neuronal models. In this paper, we report the use of human neurons derived from normal cord blood CD34+ cells generated via genetic reprogramming, as an in vitro model for the study T. gondii in neurons. This culture method resulted in a relatively pure monolayer of induced human neuronal-like cells that stained positive for neuronal markers, MAP2, NFL, \{NFH\} and NeuN. These induced human neuronal-like cells (iHNs) were efficiently infected by the Prugniad strain of the parasite and supported replication of the tachyzoite stage and development of the cyst stage. Infected iHNs could be maintained through 5 days of infection, allowing for formation of large cysts. This induced human neuronal model represents a novel culture method to study both tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages of T. gondii in human neurons. "

To treat disorders of the central nervous system drug transporter molecules based on catalytically inactive clostridial neurotoxins circumventing the passage of the blood–brain-barrier are desired. Such molecules can be produced based on the highly effective botulinum neurotoxin serotype A incorporating the retrograde axonal sorting property of tetanus neurotoxin which is supposed to be encoded within its C-terminal cell binding domain HC. The corresponding exchange of the tetanus neurotoxin HC-fragment in botulinum neurotoxin A yielded the novel hybrid molecule \{AATT\} which displayed decreased potency at the neuromuscular junction like tetanus neurotoxin but exerted equal activity in cortical neurons compared to botulinum neurotoxin A wild-type. Minimizing the tetanus neurotoxin cell binding domain to its N- or C-terminal half drastically reduced the potencies of \{AATA\} and \{AAAT\} in cortical neurons indicating that the structural motif mediating sorting of tetanus neurotoxin is predominantly encoded within the entire HC-fragment. However, the reciprocal exchange resulted in \{TTAA\} which showed a similar potency as tetanus neurotoxin at the neuromuscular junction indicating that the tetanus neurotoxin portion prevents a high potency as observed for botulinum neurotoxins. In conclusion, clostridial neurotoxin based inactivated drug transporter for targeting central neurons should contain the cell binding domain of tetanus neurotoxin to exert its tropism for the central nervous system.

Rats were ipsilaterally injected with two distinct fluorescent retrograde tracers into the \{IL\} and \{PL\} and then underwent fear conditioning, extinction and retrieval in distinct contexts. Ventral hippocampal neurons were found to project to both \{IL\} and PL, and a small number of neurons projected to both regions. Fos expression was similarly elevated in each subpopulation of mPFC-projecting neuron in animals tested outside the extinction context relative to those tested in the extinction context or home controls. Interestingly, this pattern of results is not consistent with circuit models suggesting a differential role for \{VH\} projections to \{PL\} and \{IL\} in the bidirectional regulation of fear expression after extinction. Rather, these data suggest that projections from the \{VH\} to both \{PL\} and \{IL\} are uniquely involved in fear renewal, but not the suppression of fear after extinction. \{VH\} neurons may drive fear renewal by fostering fear expression by exciting \{PL\} while limiting fear suppression by inhibiting IL.

The windup level to repetitive electrical stimulation of 1.0 Hz (16 pulses, suprathreshold for C-fiber activation, 2.0 ms) was significantly decreased by morphine in deep (n = 8), but not superficial (n = 11), \{WDR\} neurons.

In separate experiments, spinal administration of naloxone facilitated the development of windup to 0.2 Hz stimulation in deep (n = 10), but not superficial (n = 8), \{WDR\} neurons. Accordingly, morphine and naloxone modulation of neuronal activity may be related to a specific effect on neuronal sensitization/plasticity in deep \{WDR\} neurons, whereas morphine inhibition may depress acute noxious inputs to superficial \{WDR\} neurons. Our study suggests that mu-opioidergic modulation may be different in deep and superficial \{WDR\} neurons. "

We previously implicated \{GABAergic\} deficits onto layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the pathogenesis of neocortical hyperexcitability, and perhaps epilepsy, in \{AS\} model mice. Here we investigate consequences of selective Ube3a loss from either \{GABAergic\} or glutamatergic neurons, focusing on the development of hyperexcitability within L2/3 neocortex and in broader circuit and behavioral contexts. We find that \{GABAergic\} Ube3a loss causes AS-like increases in neocortical \{EEG\} delta power, enhances seizure susceptibility, and leads to presynaptic accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs)—all without decreasing \{GABAergic\} inhibition onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Conversely, glutamatergic Ube3a loss fails to yield \{EEG\} abnormalities, seizures, or associated \{CCV\} phenotypes, despite impairing tonic inhibition onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons. These results substantiate \{GABAergic\} Ube3a loss as the principal cause of circuit hyperexcitability in \{AS\} mice, lending insight into ictogenic mechanisms in AS. "

We propose an epigenetic account for understanding developmental changes in sensorimotor systems, including variations in mirror neuron activity.

Multiple studies have shown ketamine to be neurotoxic, particularly when administered during the brain growth spurt. Previously, we have shown that ketamine is detrimental to motor neuron development in the zebrafish embryos. Here, using both wild type (WT) and transgenic (hb9:GFP) zebrafish embryos, we demonstrate that ketamine is neurotoxic to both motor and sensory neurons. Drug absorption studies showed that in the \{WT\} embryos, ketamine accumulation was approximately 0.4% of the original dose added to the exposure medium. The transgenic embryos express green fluorescent protein (GFP) localized in the motor neurons making them ideal for evaluating motor neuron development and toxicities in vivo. The hb9:GFP zebrafish embryos (28 h post fertilization) treated with 2 mM ketamine for 20 h demonstrated significant reductions in spinal motor neuron numbers, while co-treatment with acetyl l-carnitine proved to be neuroprotective. In whole mount immunohistochemical studies using \{WT\} embryos, a similar effect was observed for the primary sensory neurons. In the ketamine-treated \{WT\} embryos, the number of primary sensory Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons was significantly reduced compared to that in controls. However, acetyl l-carnitine co-treatment prevented ketamine-induced adverse effects on the \{RB\} neurons. These results suggest that acetyl l-carnitine protects both motor and sensory neurons from ketamine-induced neurotoxicity. "

The aim of the study was to find out if muscle input induced by injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) can be used as an animal model for studying spinal mechanisms involved in widespread myofascial low back pain. Electrophysiological recordings from rat dorsal horn neurons were made in vivo to study alterations in their responsiveness caused by 2 injections of \{NGF\} into the multifidus muscle at an interval of 5 days. \{NGF\} is known to be closely associated with many painful muscle disorders. The results demonstrate that the 2 \{NGF\} injections—but not a single one—caused a significant hyperexcitability of spinal neurons. Five days after the first \{NGF\} injection, the neurons were not significantly sensitized but were easier to sensitize by a second injection. The state of the neurons resembles nociceptive priming. Important findings were that the proportion of neurons having multiple receptive fields (RFs) in various tissues was significantly higher after 2 \{NGF\} injections, and new \{RFs\} appeared on the distal hind limb. The new \{RFs\} were located not in the skin but in deep tissues (muscles, thoracolumbar fascia). If similar changes occur in patients, the data might explain the diffuse nature and spread of myofascial low back pain. "

We report that PV+ interneurons employ a novel CaMK-dependent pathway to trigger \{CREB\} phosphorylation and gene expression. As in excitatory neurons, voltage-gated Ca2+ influx through CaV1 channels triggers CaM nuclear translocation via local Ca2+ signaling. However, PV+ interneurons are distinct in that nuclear signaling is mediated by γCaMKI, not γCaMKII. \{CREB\} phosphorylation also proceeds with slow, sigmoid kinetics, rate-limited by paucity of CaMKIV, protecting against saturation of phospho-CREB in the face of higher firing rates and bigger Ca2+ transients. Our findings support the generality of CaM shuttling to drive nuclear CaMK activity, and they are relevant to disease pathophysiology, insofar as dysfunction of PV+ interneurons and molecules underpinning their excitation-transcription coupling both relate to neuropsychiatric disease.

Moreover, TPEN-induced caspase-3 activity was further increased by the pretreatment with U0126, but it was further decreased by the pretreatment with NGF.

The elementary \{ND\} is based upon a circuit with at least ten interconnected \{CMOS\} transistors in order to obtain a sigmoid response activation function (in this example) with multiple inputs typically as per the McCulloch and Pitts model. Given that a large number of \{NDs\} are required to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the power consumption of such a structure is a key topic that is also addressed. Another open question concerns the dispersion response due to process variability. This study reports on a new single undoped Formal Neuron Transistor (NT) solution. "

Therefore, we compared the in vitro behavior of \{NSCs\} expanded from the micro-dissected \{CA1\} and \{CA3\} subfields of postnatal day (PND) 4 and 12 Fischer 344 rats. A small fraction (∼1%) of dissociated cells from \{CA1\} and \{CA3\} subfields of both \{PND\} 4 and 12 hippocampi formed neurospheres in the presence of \{EGF\} and FGF-2. A vast majority of neurosphere cells expressed \{NSC\} markers such as nestin, Sox-2 and Musashi-1. Differentiation assays revealed the ability of these \{NSCs\} to give rise to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, the overall neuronal differentiation of \{NSCs\} from both subfields decreased with age (23–28% at \{PND4\} to 5–10% at PND12) but the extent of oligodendrocyte differentiation from \{NSCs\} increased with age (24–32% at \{PND\} 4 to 45–55% at \{PND\} 12). Differentiation of \{NSCs\} into astrocytes was however unchanged (40–48%). Furthermore, \{NSCs\} from both subfields gave rise to GABA-ergic neurons including subclasses expressing markers such as calbindin, calretinin, neuropeptide Y and parvalbumin. However, the fraction of neurons that expressed \{GABA\} decreased between \{PND4\} (59–67%) and \{PND\} 12 (25–38%). Additional analyses revealed the presence of proliferating NSC-like cells (i.e. cells expressing Ki-67 and Sox-2) in different strata of hippocampal \{CA1\} and \{CA3\} subfields of both \{PND4\} and \{PND\} 12 animals. Thus, multipotent \{NSCs\} persist in both \{CA1\} and \{CA3\} subfields of the hippocampus in the postnatal period. Such \{NSCs\} also retain their ability to give rise to both GABA-ergic and non-GABA-ergic neurons. However, their overall neurogenic potential declines considerably in the early postnatal period. "

Ca2 + imaging revealed that brief application (15–30 s) of each of the three agonists induced homologous desensitization. Heterologous desensitization also occurred when one agonist was applied prior to another agonist. OA-NO2 was more effective in desensitizing the response to \{AITC\} than the response to capsaicin. Prolonged exposure to OA-NO2 (20 min) had a similar desensitizing effect on \{AITC\} or capsaicin. Homologous and heterologous desensitizations were also demonstrated with patch clamp recording. Deltamethrin, a phosphatase inhibitor, reduced the capsaicin or \{AITC\} induced desensitization of OA-NO2 but did not suppress the OA-NO2 induced desensitization of \{AITC\} or capsaicin, indicating that heterologous desensitization induced by either capsaicin or \{AITC\} occurs by a different mechanism than the desensitization produced by OA-NO2. Subcutaneous injection of OA-NO2 (2.5 mM, 35 μl) into a rat hindpaw induced delayed and prolonged nociceptive behavior. Homologous desensitization occurred with \{AITC\} and capsaicin when applied at 15 minute intervals, but did not occur with OA-NO2 when applied at a 30 min interval. Pretreatment with OA-NO2 reduced AITC-evoked nociceptive behaviors but did not alter capsaicin responses. These results raise the possibility that OA-NO2 might be useful clinically to reduce neurogenic inflammation and certain types of painful sensations by desensitizing \{TRPA1\} expressing nociceptive afferents.

It is widely considered to be an important biomarker for several neuronal diseases as well as blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. In this report, we demonstrate a \{BBB\} deficiency in mice that lack \{S100B\} through detection of leaked Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the brain parenchyma. IgG leaks and IgG-binding to selected neurons were observed in \{S100B\} knockout (S100BKO) mice at 6 months of age but not at 3 months. By 9 months, IgG leaks persisted and the density of IgG-bound neurons increased significantly. These results reveal a chronic increase in \{BBB\} permeability upon aging in \{S100BKO\} mice for the first time. Moreover, coincident with the increase in IgG-bound neurons, autoantibodies targeting brain proteins were detected in the serum via western blots. These events were concurrent with compromise of neurons, increase of activated microglia and lack of astrocytic activation as evidenced by decreased expression of microtubule-associated protein type 2 (MAP2), elevated number of \{CD68\} positive cells and unaltered expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) respectively. Results suggest a key role for \{S100B\} in maintaining \{BBB\} functional integrity and, further, propose the \{S100BKO\} mouse as a valuable model system to explore the link between chronic functional compromise of the BBB, generation of brain-reactive autoantibodies and neuronal dysfunctions.

abstract = "Abstract Neuronal morphology is hugely variable across brain regions and species, and their classification strategies are a matter of intense debate in neuroscience. \{GABAergic\} cortical interneurons have been a challenge because it is difficult to find a set of morphological properties which clearly define neuronal types. A group of 48 neuroscience experts around the world were asked to classify a set of 320 cortical \{GABAergic\} interneurons according to the main features of their three-dimensional morphological reconstructions. A methodology for building a model which captures the opinions of all the experts was proposed. First, one Bayesian network was learned for each expert, and we proposed an algorithm for clustering Bayesian networks corresponding to experts with similar behaviors. Then, a Bayesian network which represents the opinions of each group of experts was induced. Finally, a consensus Bayesian multinet which models the opinions of the whole group of experts was built. A thorough analysis of the consensus model identified different behaviors between the experts when classifying the interneurons in the experiment. A set of characterizing morphological traits for the neuronal types was defined by performing inference in the Bayesian multinet. These findings were used to validate the model and to gain some insights into neuron morphology. "

The approach uses an incremental learning scheme to simultaneously granulate the input space and update the neural network weights. The neural network structure and parameters evolve simultaneously as data are input. Initially the space of each input variable is granulated using two complementary triangular membership functions. New triangular membership functions may be added, excluded and/or have their parameters adjusted depending on the input data and modeling error. The parameters of the network are updated using a gradient-based scheme with optimal learning rate. The performance of the approach is evaluated using instances of times series forecasting and nonlinear system identification problems. Computational experiments and comparisons against alternative evolving models show that the evolving neural neo-fuzzy network is accurate and fast, characteristics which are essential for adaptive systems modeling, especially in real-time, on-line environments.

It is found that all the three classes of neurons can encode an external stimulus into FSLs. With \{DC\} inputs, the \{FSLs\} of all of the neurons decrease with input intensity. With input current decreased to the threshold, class 1 neurons show an arbitrary long \{FSL\} whereas class 2 and 3 neurons exhibit the short-limit FSLs. When the input current is sinusoidal, the amplitude, frequency and initial phase can be encoded by all the three classes of neurons. The \{FSLs\} of all of the neurons decrease with the input amplitude and frequency. When the input frequency is too high, all of the neurons respond with infinite FSLs. When the initial phase increases, the \{FSL\} decreases and then jumps to a maximal value and finally decreases linearly. With changes in the input parameters, the \{FSLs\} of the class 1 and 2 neurons exhibit similar properties. However, the \{FSL\} of the class 3 neurons became slightly longer and only produces responses for a narrow range of initial phase if input frequencies are low. Moreover, our results also show that the \{FSL\} and firing rate responses are mutually independent processes and that neurons can encode an external stimulus into different \{FSLs\} and firing rates simultaneously. This finding is consistent with the current theory of dual or multiple complementary coding mechanisms. "

NF-κB has been reported to be present in neurons wherein it reportedly responds to immune and toxic stimuli, glutamate, and synaptic activity. However, because the brain contains many cell types, assays specifically measuring neuronal NF-κB activity are difficult to perform and interpret. To address this, we compared NF-κB activity in cultures of primary neocortical neurons, mixed brain cells, and liver cells, employing Western blot of NF-κB subunits, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of nuclear κB \{DNA\} binding, reporter assay of κB \{DNA\} binding, immunofluorescence of the NF-κB subunit protein p65, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of NF-κB-regulated gene expression, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of produced proteins. Assay of p65 showed its constitutive presence in cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons at levels significantly lower than in mixed brain or liver cells. \{EMSA\} and reporter assays showed that constitutive NF-κB activity was nearly absent in neurons. Induced activity was minimal—many fold lower than in other cell types, as measured by phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor IκBα, nuclear accumulation of p65, binding to κB \{DNA\} consensus sites, NF-κB reporting, or induction of NF-κB-responsive genes. The most efficacious activating stimuli for neurons were the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-beta (IL-β). Neuronal NF-κB was not responsive to glutamate in most assays, and it was also unresponsive to hydrogen peroxide, lipopolysaccharide, norepinephrine, ATP, phorbol ester, and nerve growth factor. The chemokine gene transcripts CCL2, CXCL1, and \{CXCL10\} were strongly induced via NF-κB activation by TNFα in neurons, but many candidate responsive genes were not, including the neuroprotective genes \{SOD2\} and Bcl-xL. Importantly, the level of induced neuronal NF-κB activity in response to TNFα or any other stimulus was lower than the level of constitutive activity in non-neuronal cells, calling into question the functional significance of neuronal NF-κB activity.

Whether genes downstream from NRF-1 differentially regulate axonal and dendritic outgrowth in neurons remains largely unknown. Three hypothetical genes, C3orf10, FAM134C, and ENOX1, were investigated because their NRF-1 response elements are 100% conserved in humans and mice. We found that NRF-1 positively regulates \{FAM134C\} and ENOX1, but negatively regulates \{C3orf10\} in human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells and primary rat cortical neurons. In IMR-32 cells, \{FAM134C\} positively regulates and \{C3orf10\} negatively regulates neurite outgrowth, but \{ENOX1\} plays no role in neurite outgrowth regulation. \{FAM134C\} but not \{C3orf10\} mediates NRF-1-enhanced neurite outgrowth. In primary rat hippocampal neurons, Fam134c is predominantly expressed in the axon hillock and \{C3orf10\} is ubiquitously expressed in all neurites and cell bodies at different developmental stages, suggesting their roles in axonal and dendritic outgrowth. Knockdown of Fam134c decreased both axonal length and the number of axonal collaterals and dendrites, however, knockdown of \{C3orf10\} only increased the number of axonal collaterals and dendrites. Overall, we annotated FAM134C, C3orf10, and \{ENOX1\} as NRF-1-regulated genes, which have differential effects on neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells as well as neurons. This study provided an effective platform for annotating hypothetical genes in the human genome and increasing our knowledge in the molecular network underlying neuronal differentiation. "

Electrophysiological results showed that ghrelin could excite GD-excitatory (GD-E) neurons and inhibit GD-inhibitory (GD-I) neurons in the Arc. However, fewer GD-E neurons were excited by ghrelin and the excitatory effect of ghrelin on GD-E neurons was much weaker in \{DM\} rats. Gastric motility research in vivo showed that microinjection of ghrelin into the Arc could significantly promote gastric motility and it showed a dose-dependent manner. The effect of ghrelin promoting gastric motility in \{DM\} rats was weaker than that in normal rats. The effects induced by ghrelin could be blocked by growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) antagonist [d-Lys-3]-GHRP-6 or BIM28163. \{RIA\} and real-time \{PCR\} data showed that the levels of ghrelin in the plasma, stomach and ghrelin mRNA in the Arc increased at first but decreased later and the expression of GHSR-1a mRNA in the Arc maintained a low level in \{DM\} rats. The present findings indicate that ghrelin could regulate the activity of \{GD\} sensitive neurons and gastric motility via ghrelin receptors in the Arc. The reduced effects of promoting gastric motility induced by ghrelin could be connected with the decreased expression of ghrelin receptors in the Arc in diabetes. Our data provide new experimental evidence for the role of ghrelin in gastric motility disorder in diabetes. "

The role of IgG which is an important immunologic molecule in the process of Parkinson's disease has been unclear. Evidence suggests that IgG can be produced by neurons in addition to its traditionally recognized source B lymphocytes, but its function in neurons is poorly understood. In this study, extensive expression of neuron-derived IgG was demonstrated in dopaminergic neurons of human and rat mesencephalon. With an in vitro Parkinson's disease model, we found that neuron-derived IgG can improve the survival and reduce apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons induced by 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity, and also depress the release of \{NO\} from microglia triggered by 6-hydroxydopamine. Expression of TNF-α and IL-10 in microglia was elevated to protective levels by neuron-derived IgG at a physiologic level via the FcγR I and \{TLR4\} pathways and microglial activation could be attenuated by IgG blocking. All these data suggested that neuron-derived IgG may exert a self-protective function by activating microglia properly, and IgG may be involved in maintaining immunity homeostasis in the central nervous system and serve as an active factor under pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.

However, the Aβs contribution by the more numerous astrocytes remains undetermined. Previously we showed that fibrillar (f)Aβ25–35, an Aβ42 proxy, evokes a surplus endogenous Aβ42 production/accumulation in cortical adult human astrocytes. Here, by using immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, enzymatic assays, and highly sensitive sandwich \{ELISA\} kits, we investigated the effects of fAβ25–35 and soluble (s)Aβ25–35 on Aβ42 and Aβ40 accumulation/secretion by human cortical astrocytes and HCN-1A neurons and, since the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) binds Aβs, their modulation by \{NPS\} 2143, a CaSR allosteric antagonist (calcilytic). The fAβ25–35-exposed astrocytes and surviving neurons produced, accumulated, and secreted increased amounts of Aβ42, while Aβ40 also accrued but its secretion was unchanged. Accordingly, secreted Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio values rose for astrocytes and neurons. While slightly enhancing Aβ40 secretion by fAβ25–35-treated astrocytes, \{NPS\} 2143 specifically suppressed the fAβ25–35-elicited surges of endogenous Aβ42 secretion by astrocytes and neurons. Therefore, \{NPS\} 2143 addition always kept Aβ42/Aβ40 values to baseline or lower levels. Mechanistically, \{NPS\} 2143 decreased total CaSR protein complement, transiently raised proteasomal chymotrypsin activity, and blocked excess \{NO\} production without affecting the ongoing increases in BACE1/β-secretase and γ-secretase activity in fAβ25–35-treated astrocytes. Compared to fAβ25–35, sAβ25–35 also stimulated Aβ42 secretion by astrocytes and neurons and \{NPS\} 2143 specifically and wholly suppressed this effect. Therefore, since \{NPS\} 2143 thwarts any Aβ/CaSR-induced surplus secretion of endogenous Aβ42 and hence further vicious cycles of Aβ self-induction/secretion/spreading, calcilytics might effectively prevent/stop the progression to full-blown AD.

Here we identified a pair of giant visual projection neurons located laterally to the calyx of the mushroom bodies, and investigated their electrophysiological, morphological characteristics, as well as the development pathways during eclosion. The typical morphology of these giant neurons showed the size of the soma (16.0 ± 0.6 microns in diameter) and its processes. Interestingly during development, the three major branches shrunk significantly along with gradually decreased rhythmic spikes. Furthermore, the electrical activity of the giant visual projection neurons is circadian-regulated, shown with significantly higher resting membrane potential, increase in frequency of spontaneous action potential firing, and burst firing pattern during circadian day and night time. The similarities in the morphological characteristics with other visual projection neurons highly suggest that this neuron is a type of novel visual projection neurons in this area, which has special properties in light sensitivities and rhythmic activities. Our data provided supporting evidence for the visual projection neurons with light sensitivities, and pointed to the potential correlation of visual projection neurons and circadian rhythms during the eclosion period or an adaptive development for higher sensitivity of light in adult visual systems.

In the present study, we explored the interaction between the two systems by examining the mutual effects between TNF-α and the Ang II/AT1 receptor axis in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Rat \{DRG\} neurons were treated with TNF-α in different concentrations for different lengths of time in the presence or absence of transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, \{TNF\} receptor 1 (TNFR1) inhibitor SPD304, β-catenin signaling inhibitor CCT031374, or different kinase inhibitors. TNF-α decreased the \{AT1\} receptor mRNA level as well as the \{AT1a\} receptor promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner within 30 h, which led to dose-dependent inhibition of Ang II-binding \{AT1\} receptor level on the cell membrane. Actinomycin D (1 mg/ml), \{SPD304\} (50 μM), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor \{PD169316\} (25 μM), and \{CCT031374\} (50 μM) completely abolished the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on \{AT1\} receptor expression. TNF-α dose-dependently increased soluble β-catenin and phosphorylated GSK-3β levels, which was blocked by \{SPD304\} and PD169316. In \{DRG\} neurons treated with \{AT2\} receptor agonist CGP421140, or Ang \{II\} with or without \{AT1\} receptor antagonist losartan or \{AT2\} receptor antagonist \{PD123319\} for 30 h, we found that Ang \{II\} and Ang \{II\} + \{PD123319\} significantly decreased TNF-α expression, whereas \{CPG421140\} and Ang \{II\} + losartan increased TNF-α expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TNF-α inhibits \{AT1\} receptor expression at the transcription level via \{TNFR1\} in rat \{DRG\} neurons by increasing the soluble β-catenin level through the p38 MAPK/GSK-3β pathway. In addition, Ang \{II\} appears to inhibit and induce TNF-α expression via the \{AT1\} receptor and the \{AT2\} receptor in \{DRG\} neurons, respectively. This is the first evidence of crosstalk between TNF-α and the Ang II/AT receptor axis in \{DRG\} neurons. "

Even though activin receptor type \{II\} has been detected in spiral ganglion neurons (SGN), little is known about the role of activins in the inner ear. An activin-mediated neuroprotection is of considerable clinical interest since \{SGN\} are targets of electrical stimulation with cochlear implants in hearing impaired patients. Thus, the presence of activin type-I and type-II receptors was demonstrated immunocytochemically and the individual and combined effects of activin A, erythropoietin (EPO) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on \{SGN\} were examined in vitro. \{SGN\} isolated from neonatal rats (P 3–5) were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with activin A, \{BDNF\} and EPO. Compared to the negative control, survival rates of \{SGN\} were significantly improved when cultivated individually with activin A (p &lt; 0.001) and in combination with \{BDNF\} (p &lt; 0.001). Neither neurite outgrowth nor neuronal survival was influenced by the addition of \{EPO\} to activin A-treated neurons. However, when all three factors were added, a significantly (p &lt; 0.001) improved neuronal survival was observed (61.2 ± 3.6%) compared to activin A (25.4 ± 2.1%), \{BDNF\} (22.8 ± 3.3%) and BDNF + EPO (19.2 ± 1.5%).

abstract = "Abstract Depressive disorders have been linked to the combined dysregulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)-axis and the serotonergic system. The HPA-axis and serotonergic (5-HT) neurons exert reciprocal regulatory actions. It has been reported that glucocorticoid-glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling influences serotonin transporter (5-HTT) transcription but data also points to the fact that 5-HTT expression is regulated nongenomically via redistribution of 5-HTT from the cell surface into intracellular compartments. In order to analyze the acute effects of glucocorticoids on 5-HTT cell surface localization we differentiated serotonergic neurons from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from the C57BL/6N blastocysts. These postmitotic 5-HT neurons express all relevant serotonergic markers following the application of a growth factor-based differentiation protocol. Increasing concentrations of the \{GR\} agonist dexamethasone (Dex) resulted in enhanced, dose-dependent 5-HTT cell surface localization in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide already 1 h after incubation. Inhibition of \{GR\} function by the specific GR-antagonist mifepristone abolished the increase in 5-HTT cell surface localization. Hence, our data account for a nongenomic upregulation of 5-HTT cell surface expression by glucocorticoid–GR interaction which likely constitutes a rapid physiological response to increased levels of glucocorticoids as seen during stress. Taken together, we provide a cellular model to analyze and dissect glucocorticoid–5HTT interactions on a molecular level that corresponds to in vivo animal models using C57BL/6N mice. "

Plasmids containing LIN28–green fluorescent protein (GFP) or \{GFP\} were introduced into the embryonic mouse brains at E14.5 by in utero electroporation. Two days after electroporation, embryonic cortices were harvested and cultured. It was found that transfected cells stably overexpressed \{LIN28\} in vitro. Viability curve from live cell imaging showed that the number of GFP-expressing cells decreased over time in line with naive primary cortical neurons. In contrast, the number of LIN28–GFP-overexpressing neurons initially increased and remained high at later time-points in culture than GFP-expressing cells. Double immunofluorescence showed that at an early time in culture, the number of Ki-67/GFP double-positive cells was higher in the LIN28–GFP group than that of controls. Moreover, there were significantly lower numbers of condensed nuclei/GFP- and cleaved caspase-3/GFP-positive cells in the LIN28–GFP groups compared to control GFP. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the LIN28–GFP-expressing cells at days in vitro (DIV)13 were neuronal nuclei (NeuN)-positive mature neurons. Finally, the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) was induced in LIN28-expressing primary cortical neurons, which was not detected in controls. Taken together, our results indicate that the expression of exogenous \{LIN28\} can promote the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and exert prosurvival effect on primary cortical neurons by inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptosis, possibly via upregulation of IGF-2.

We previously showed that the immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule, nectin-like molecule-2 (Necl-2)/CADM1, interacts with the ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors, and that the interaction of Necl-2 with ErbB3 inhibits the Nrg1-induced ErbB3/ErbB2 signaling in epithelial cells. Here, we examined the role of the interaction of Necl-2 with ErbB4 in \{GABAergic\} neurons. Necl-2 was co-expressed with ErbB4 in parvalbumin-positive \{GABAergic\} neurons in the mouse hippocampus and co-localized with ErbB4 at excitatory synapses. Necl-2 knockdown enhanced the Nrg1-induced phosphorylation of ErbB4. Moreover, overexpression of PTPN13, which is a tyrosine phosphatase bound to the cytoplasmic tail of Necl-2, suppressed the Nrg1-induced development of excitatory synapses in \{GABAergic\} neurons through the inhibition of ErbB4 activity. These results indicate that Necl-2 interacts with ErbB4 and regulates the development of excitatory synapses via the regulation of ErbB4 activity in \{GABAergic\} neurons. "

In the present work we tested if anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which had been proven to be effective for treating neuropathic pain, had the opposite effect. Western blot and immunofluorescence results showed that IL-10 receptor was localized in \{DRG\} neurons. Recombinant rat IL-10 (200 pg/ml) not only reduced the densities of TTX-sensitive and Nav1.8 currents in control \{DRG\} neurons, but also reversed the increase of the sodium currents induced by rat recombinant TNF-α (100 pg/ml), as revealed by patch-clamp recordings. Consistent with the electrophysiological results, real-time \{PCR\} and western blot revealed that IL-10 (200 pg/ml) down-regulated \{VGSCs\} in both mRNA and protein levels and reversed the up-regulation of \{VGSCs\} by TNF-α. Moreover, repetitive intrathecal administration of rrIL-10 for 3 days (4 times per day) attenuated mechanical allodynia in \{L5\} spinal nerve ligation model and profoundly inhibited the excitability of \{DRG\} neurons. These results suggested that the down-regulation of the sodium channels in \{DRG\} neurons might contribute to the therapeutic effect of IL-10 on neuropathic pain. "

Using the coupled neuron–astrocyte model and based on the results of the phase plane analyses, it is demonstrated that the astrocyte is able to activate the silent neuron or change the neuron spiking frequency through bidirectional communication. This suggests that astrocyte feedback signaling is capable of modulating spike transmission frequency by changing neuron spiking frequency. This effect is described by a saddle–node on invariant circle bifurcation in the coupled neuron–astrocyte model. In this way, our results suggest that the neuron–astrocyte crosstalk has a fundamental role in producing diverse neuronal activities and therefore enhances the information processing capabilities of the brain.

Therefore, to evaluate whether physical exercise and environment exploration are able to affect synapse formation and the maturation of adult-generated neurons, GFP-retrovirus infusion was performed on rats which, on the fourth day after injection, were housed under running conditions or allowed to explore an enriched environment briefly in the absence of exercise for the following three days. Afterward, at the end of the trainings, electrophysiological and morphological studies were conducted. Considering that neurotrophic factors increase after exercise or environment exploration, hippocampal \{BDNF\} levels and TrkB receptor activation were evaluated. In this study, we show that both spontaneous physical activity and enriched environment exploration induced synaptogenesis and T-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents in very immature neurons. Hippocampal \{BDNF\} levels and TrkB receptor activation were determined to be increasing following physical activity and exploration. A possible contribution of \{BDNF\} signaling in mediating the observed effects was supported by the use of 7-8-dihydroxyflavone, a selective TrkB agonist, and of ANA-12, an inhibitor of TrkB receptors.

Remarkably, \{FGF19\} treatment has hypoglycemic actions that remain potent in models of genetic and acquired insulin resistance. Here, we provided evidence that the central nervous system responds to \{FGF19\} administered in the periphery. Then, in two mouse models of insulin resistance, leptin-deficiency and high-fat diet feeding, third intra-cerebro-ventricular infusions of \{FGF19\} improved glycemic status, reduced insulin resistance and potentiated insulin signaling in the periphery. In addition, our study highlights a new mechanism of central \{FGF19\} action, involving the suppression of AGRP/NPY neuronal activity. Overall, our work unveils novel regulatory pathways induced by \{FGF19\} that will be useful in the design of novel strategies to control diabetes in obesity. "

However, little is known about Ca2+ signals by which dopamine neurons maintain an optimum spontaneous firing rate. In the midbrain dopamine neurons, we here show that spontaneous firing evoked [Ca2+]c changes in a phasic manner in the dendritic region but a tonic manner in the soma. Tonic levels of somatic [Ca2+]c strictly tallied with spontaneous firing rates. However, manipulatory raising or lowering of [Ca2+]c with caged compounds from the resting firing state proportionally suppressed or raised spontaneous firing rate, respectively, suggesting presence of the homeostatic regulation mechanism for spontaneous firing rate via tonic [Ca2+]c changes of the soma. More importantly, abolition of this homeostatic regulation mechanism significantly exaggerated the responses of tonic firings and high-frequency phasic discharges to glutamate. Therefore, we conclude that this Ca2+-dependent homeostatic regulation mechanism is responsible for not only maintaining optimum rate of spontaneous firing, but also proper responses to glutamate. Perturbation of this mechanism could cause dopamine neurons to be more vulnerable to glutamate and Ca2+ toxicities. "

In this capacity, \{VEGF\} signaling can rescue neurons from the damage induced by stressful stimuli many of which elicit oxidative stress. However, the regulatory role that VEGFR-2 plays in providing neuroprotection remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated the effects of VEGFR-2 inhibition on primary cultures of mature hippocampal neurons undergoing nutritional stress. We found that neurons cultured under nutritional stress had increased expression of \{VEGF\} and its receptors, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and NP-1, as well as enhanced levels of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation. These neurons also showed increased activation of the prosurvival pathways for MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt, enhanced phosphorylation (inactivation) of the proapoptotic BAD, and higher levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, all of which were augmented by treatments with exogenous \{VEGF\} and blocked by VEGFR-2 inhibition. The blockade of VEGFR-2 function also elicited a cytotoxicity that was accompanied by caspase-3 activation, induction of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), oxidative stress, and a collapse in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Knockdown of VEGFR-2 by siRNA generated a similar pattern of redox change and mitochondrial impairment. Pretreatments with VEGF, VEGF-B, or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) rescued \{SU1498\} or siRNA-treated neurons from the mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by VEGFR-2 inhibition in a timely fashion. These findings suggested that \{VEGF\} or VEGF-B can provide neuroprotection by signaling through an alternate \{VEGF\} receptor. Together, our findings suggest that \{VEGF\} signaling through VEGFR-2 plays a critical regulatory role in protecting stressed hippocampal neurons from the damaging effects of an oxidative insult. These findings also implicate VEGFR-1 or NP-1 as compensatory receptors that mediate neuroprotection when VEGFR-2 function is blocked. "

Fluorescence-based analysis of the dynamics of cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c) in cultured hippocampal neurons shows that electrical stimulation depolarizes the neurons and increases the dendritic [Ca2+]c, which then decays slowly to the pre-stimulus level. Whereas the peak amplitude of [Ca2+]c was not affected, the decay period was prolonged in neurons of heterozygous mice whose genotype reflects the human condition. We found that this effect was blocked by the antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors, and confirmed that glutamate receptors are present in these neurons. As the [Ca2+]c is readout and regulator of neuronal excitability, its abnormality represents an important cellular phenotype of dystonia "

The characteristic features are onset in young, weakness and wasting of limbs, multiple lower cranial nerve palsies and sensorineural hearing loss. There is a considerable overlap in the phenotype of \{MMND\} with Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome (BVVL) Boltshauser syndrome, Nathalie syndrome and Fazio–Londe syndrome. Recently a number of \{BVVL\} cases and families have been described with mutations in two riboflavin transporter genes \{SLC52A2\} and \{SLC52A3\} (solute carrier family 52, riboflavin transporter, member 2 and 3 respectively). Methods and results We describe six families and four sporadic \{MMND\} cases that have been clinically characterized in detail with history, examination, imaging and electrophysiological investigations. We sequenced the SLC52A1, \{SLC52A2\} and \{SLC52A3\} in affected probands and sporadic individuals from the \{MMND\} series as well as the \{C9ORF72\} expansion. No genetic defects were identified and the \{C9ORF72\} repeats were all less than 10. Conclusions These data suggest that \{MMND\} is a distinct clinical subgroup of childhood onset \{MND\} patients where the known genetic defects are so far negative. The clinico-genetic features of \{MMND\} in comparison with the \{BVVL\} group of childhood motor neuron diseases suggest that these diseases are likely to share a common defective biological pathway that may be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

We used an in vitro preparation of adult murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons co-cultured with fibrosarcoma cells to investigate how tumors alter the uptake of \{AEA\} into neurons. Evidence that the uptake of [3H]AEA into dissociated \{DRG\} cells in the co-culture model mimicked the increase in uptake that occurred in \{DRG\} cells from tumor-bearing mice supported the utility of the in vitro model to study \{AEA\} uptake. Results with the fluorescent \{AEA\} analog \{CAY10455\} confirmed that an increase in uptake in the co-culture model occurred in neurons. One factor that contributed to the increase in [3H]AEA uptake was an increase in total cellular cholesterol in the cancer condition. Treatment with the \{FAAH\} inhibitor \{URB597\} reduced \{CAY10455\} uptake in the co-culture model to the level observed in \{DRG\} neurons maintained in the control condition (i.e., in the absence of fibrosarcoma cells), and this effect was paralleled by OMDM-1, an inhibitor of \{AEA\} uptake, at a concentration that had no effect on \{FAAH\} activity. Maximally effective concentrations of the two drugs together produced a greater reduction than was observed with each drug alone. Treatment with BMS309403, which competes for \{AEA\} binding to fatty acid binding protein-5, mimicked the effect of OMDM-1 in vitro. Local injection of OMDM-1 reduced hyperalgesia in vivo in mice with unilateral tumors in and around the calcaneous bone. Intraplantar injection of OMDM-1 (5 μg) into the tumor-bearing paw reduced mechanical hyperalgesia through a CB1R-dependent mechanism and also reduced a spontaneous nocifensive behavior. The same dose reduced withdrawal responses evoked by suprathreshold mechanical stimuli in naive mice. These data support the conclusion that OMDM-1 inhibits \{AEA\} uptake by a mechanism that is independent of inhibition of \{FAAH\} and provide a rationale for the development of peripherally restricted drugs that decrease \{AEA\} uptake for the management of cancer pain.

The physiological function of \{APP\} is still not completely understood much because of the redundancy between genes in the \{APP\} family. In this study we have used zebrafish to study the physiological function of the zebrafish \{APP\} homologue, appb, during development. We show that appb is expressed in post-mitotic neurons in the spinal cord. Knockdown of appb by 50–60% results in a behavioral phenotype with increased spontaneous coiling and prolonged touch-induced activity. The spinal cord motor neurons in these embryos show defective formation and axonal outgrowth patterning. Reduction in Appb also results in patterning defects and changed density of pre- and post-synapses in the neuromuscular junctions. Together, our data show that development of functional locomotion in zebrafish depends on a critical role of Appb in the patterning of motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions. "

However, the manner in which vision influences the movement-related activity of neurons in the motor cortex is not well understood. In this study we have investigated how the locomotion-related activity of neurons in the motor cortex is modified when subjects switch between walking in the darkness and in light. Three adult cats were trained to walk through corridors of an experimental chamber for a food reward. On randomly selected trials, lights were extinguished for approximately 4 s when the cat was in a straight portion of the chamber's corridor. Discharges of 146 neurons from layer V of the motor cortex, including 51 pyramidal tract cells (PTNs), were recorded and compared between light and dark conditions. It was found that while cats’ movements during locomotion in light and darkness were similar (as judged from the analysis of three-dimensional limb kinematics and the activity of limb muscles), the firing behavior of 49% (71/146) of neurons was different between the two walking conditions. This included differences in the mean discharge rate (19%, 28/146 of neurons), depth of stride-related frequency modulation (24%, 32/131), duration of the period of elevated firing ([PEF], 19%, 25/131), and number of \{PEFs\} among stride-related neurons (26%, 34/131). 20% of responding neurons exhibited more than one type of change. We conclude that visual input plays a very significant role in determining neuronal activity in the motor cortex during locomotion by altering one, or occasionally multiple, parameters of locomotion-related discharges of its neurons.

Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of the neuronal globin protein, neuroglobin, helps diminish protein nitration, preserve mitochondrial function and sustain \{ATP\} content of primary cortical neurons challenged by extended nitric oxide exposure. Specifically, in transgenic neurons, elevated neuroglobin curtailed nitric oxide-induced alterations in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates, including baseline oxygen consumption, consumption coupled with \{ATP\} synthesis, proton leak and spare respiratory capacity. Concomitantly, activation of genes involved in sensing and responding to oxidative/nitrosative stress, including the early-immediate c-Fos gene and the phase \{II\} antioxidant enzyme, heme oxygenase-1, was diminished in neuroglobin-overexpressing compared to wild-type neurons. Taken together, these differences reflect a lesser insult produced by similar concentrations of nitric oxide in neuroglobin-overexpressing compared to wild-type neurons, suggesting that abundant neuroglobin buffers nitric oxide and raises the threshold of nitric oxide-mediated injury in neurons.

These \{ANP\} actions were blocked by anantin, a specific type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) antagonist. The results clearly indicate that \{ANP\} acts directly on glycinergic presynaptic nerve terminals to inhibit glycine release via presynaptic NPR-A. The \{ANP\} effects were not blocked by the membrane permeable cGMP analog (8Br-cGMP) suggesting a transduction mechanisms not simply related to increasing cGMP levels in nerve terminals. \{BNP\} did not affect on glycinergic sIPSCs and eIPSCs. Moreover, both \{ANP\} and \{BNP\} had no effect on glutamatergic \{EPSCs\} in hippocampal \{CA3\} neurons.

Electrophysiology using multiple electrodes provides a very high temporal resolution, but does not yield sufficient spatial information for resolving neuronal connection topology. Optical recording techniques using single-cell resolution have provided promise for providing spatial information. Although calcium imaging from hundreds of neurons has provided a novel view of the neural connections within the network, the kinetics of calcium responses are not fast enough to resolve each action potential event with high fidelity. Therefore, it is not possible to detect the direction of neuronal connections. New method We took advantage of the fast kinetics and large dynamic range of the DiO/DPA combination of voltage sensitive dye and the fast scan speed of a custom-made random-access two-photon microscope to resolve each action potential event from multiple neurons in culture. Results Long-duration recording up to 100 min from cultured hippocampal neurons yielded sufficient numbers of spike events for analyzing synaptic connections. Cross-correlation analysis of neuron pairs clearly distinguished synaptically connected neuron pairs with the connection direction. Comparison with existing method The long duration recording of action potentials with voltage-sensitive dye utilized in the present study is much longer than in previous studies. Simultaneous optical voltage and calcium measurements revealed that voltage-sensitive dye is able to detect firing events more reliably than calcium indicators. Conclusions This novel method reveals a new view of the functional structure of neuronal networks. "

I argue that the first response requires an account of the mechanism by which small-scale gestures are supposedly mapped to larger chains of actions but that none of the extant accounts of this mechanism are plausible. Section 4 then briefly examines refinements of the mirror neuron-mindreading hypothesis which avoid the intentional worry. I conclude that these refinements may well be plausible but that they undermine many of the claims standardly made for mirror neurons. "

abstract = "Abstract The small-molecule drug lithium (as a monovalent ion) promotes neurite regeneration and functional recovery, is easy to administer, and is approved for human use to treat bipolar disorder. Lithium exerts its neuritogenic effect mainly by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3, a constitutively-active serine/threonine kinase that is regulated by neurotrophin and “wingless-related \{MMTV\} integration site” (Wnt) signaling. In spiral ganglion neurons of the cochlea, the effects of lithium and the function of glycogen synthase kinase 3 have not been investigated. We, therefore, set out to test whether lithium modulates neuritogenesis from adult spiral ganglion neurons. Primary cultures of dissociated spiral ganglion neurons from adult mice were exposed to lithium at concentrations between 0 and 12.5 mM. The resulting neurite morphology and growth-cone appearance were measured in detail by using immunofluorescence microscopy and image analysis. We found that lithium altered the morphology of regenerating neurites and their growth cones in a differential, concentration-dependent fashion. Low concentrations of 0.5–2.5 mM (around the half-maximal inhibitory concentration for glycogen synthase kinase 3 and the recommended therapeutic serum concentration for bipolar disorder) enhanced neurite sprouting and branching. A high concentration of 12.5 mM, in contrast, slowed elongation. As the lithium concentration rose from low to high, the microtubules became increasingly disarranged and the growth cones more arborized. Our results demonstrate that lithium selectively stimulates phases of neuritogenesis that are driven by microtubule reorganization. In contrast, most other drugs that have previously been tested on spiral ganglion neurons are reported to inhibit neurite outgrowth or affect only elongation. Lithium sensitivity is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the involvement of glycogen synthase kinase 3. Our results are, therefore, consistent with, but do not prove lithium inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity in spiral ganglion neurons. Experiments with additional drugs and molecular-genetic tools will be necessary to test whether glycogen synthase kinase 3 regulates neurite regeneration from spiral ganglion neurons, possibly by integrating neurotrophin and Wnt signals at the growth cone.

The \{BMPRII\} receptor is particularly important in mediating remodeling of the neuronal cytoskeleton through the activation of BMPRII-bound cytoskeletal regulators, such as \{LIM\} Kinase (LIMK). Here, we show that PAK1, a key regulator of diverse neuronal processes and an upstream activator of LIMK, binds to the \{BMP\} type I receptor, ALK2. Although, \{PAK1\} is dispensable for activation of the Smad transcriptional mediators, abrogation of \{PAK1\} expression or inhibition of \{PAK1\} activity prevents BMP-induced neurite outgrowth in cultured neuroblastoma cell lines. Moreover, in primary murine embryonic cortical neurons, inhibition of \{PAK\} activity blocks BMP7-induced cofilin phosphorylation, prevents remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and thereby blocks BMP7-induced dendrite formation. Thus, we propose a model in which \{BMP7\} signaling leads to the recruitment of ALK2-bound \{PAK1\} to BMPRII, which binds a downstream regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, LIMK1, and that the \{BMP\} receptor complex thereby acts as a scaffold to localize and coordinate actin cytoskeletal remodeling. We propose that this scaffold plays a key role in mediating BMP7-dependent dendritogenesis in primary cortical neurons. "

Presumed parvalbumin-containing \{GABAergic\} interneurons (fast-spiking neurons, FSNs) were identified based on narrow spike shapes in three independent experiments, though they were a small population (4.2%, 42/997). We found that \{FSNs\} are characterized by high-frequency and less-bursty discharges, which are distinct from the basic firing properties of the presumed projection neurons (phasically active neurons, PANs). Besides, the encoded information regarding actions and outcomes was similar between \{FSNs\} and \{PANs\} in terms of proportion of neurons, but the discharge selectivity was higher in \{PANs\} than that of FSNs. The coding of actions and outcomes in \{FSNs\} and \{PANs\} was consistently observed under various behavioral contexts in distinct parts of the striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen, and anterior striatum). Our results suggest that \{FSNs\} may enhance the discharge selectivity of postsynaptic output neurons (PANs) in encoding crucial variables for a reward-directed behavior. "

Although several regions commonly observed in social tasks have been shown to be involved in imitation control, there is little work exploring how these regions interact with one another. We used fMRI and dynamic causal modeling to identify imitation-specific control mechanisms and examine functional interactions between regions. Participants performed a pre-specified action (lifting their index or middle finger) in response to videos depicting the same two actions (biological cues) or dots moving with similar trajectories (non-biological cues). On congruent trials, the stimulus and response were similar (e.g. index finger response to index finger or left side dot stimulus), while on incongruent trials the stimulus and response were dissimilar (e.g. index finger response to middle finger or right side dot stimulus). Reaction times were slower on incongruent compared to congruent trials for both biological and non-biological stimuli, replicating previous findings that suggest the automatic imitative or spatially compatible (congruent) response must be controlled on incongruent trials. Neural correlates of the congruency effects were different depending on the cue type. The medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis (IFGpo) and the left anterior insula were involved specifically in controlling imitation. In addition, the \{IFGpo\} was also more active for biological compared to non-biological stimuli, suggesting that the region represents the frontal node of the human mirror neuron system (MNS). Effective connectivity analysis exploring the interactions between these regions, suggests a role for the mPFC and \{ACC\} in imitative conflict detection and the anterior insula in conflict resolution processes, which may occur through interactions with the frontal node of the MNS. We suggest an extension of the previous models of imitation control involving interactions between imitation-specific and general cognitive control mechanisms. "

In this paper, we describe the effects of hypertonicity on the electrical properties of \{MNCs\} by focusing on the nitrergic modulation of their activity in this condition. Membrane potentials were measured using the patch clamp technique, in the presence of both glutamatergic and \{GABAergic\} neurotransmission blockers, in coronal brain slices of male Wistar rats. The recordings were first made under a control condition (295 mosm/kg H2O), then in the presence of a hypertonic stimulus (330 mosm/kg H2O) and, finally, with a hypertonic stimulus plus 500 μM l-Arginine or 100 μM N-nitro-l-Arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME). Hypertonicity per se increased the firing frequency of the neurons. l-Arginine prevented the increase in fire frequency induced by hypertonic stimulus, and l-NAME (inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) induced an additional increase in frequency when applied together with the hypertonic solution. Moreover, l-Arginine hyperpolarizes the resting potential and decreases the peak value of the after-hyperpolarization; both effects were blocked by l-NAME and hypertonicity and/or l-NAME reduced the time constant of the rising phase of the after-depolarization. These results demonstrate that an intrinsic nitrergic system is part of the mechanisms controlling the excitability of \{MNCs\} of the \{SON\} when the internal fluid homeostasis is disturbed. "

The involvement of the \{VTA\} in these various behaviors and disorders is paralleled by its diverse signaling mechanisms. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of neuronal diversity in the \{VTA\} with a focus on cell phenotypes that participate in ‘multiplexed’ neurotransmission involving distinct signaling mechanisms. First, we describe the cellular diversity within the VTA, including neurons capable of transmitting dopamine, glutamate or \{GABA\} as well as neurons capable of multiplexing combinations of these neurotransmitters. Next, we describe the complex synaptic architecture used by \{VTA\} neurons in order to accommodate the transmission of multiple transmitters. We specifically cover recent findings showing that \{VTA\} multiplexed neurotransmission may be mediated by either the segregation of dopamine and glutamate into distinct microdomains within a single axon or by the integration of glutamate and \{GABA\} into a single axon terminal. In addition, we discuss our current understanding of the functional role that these multiplexed signaling pathways have in the lateral habenula and the nucleus accumbens. Finally, we consider the putative roles of \{VTA\} multiplexed neurotransmission in synaptic plasticity and discuss how changes in \{VTA\} multiplexed neurons may relate to various psychopathologies including drug addiction and depression.

To gain insight about the neurobiology of TCF4, we created an in vivo model of \{PTHS\} by suppressing Tcf4 expression in rat prefrontal neurons immediately prior to neurogenesis. This cell-autonomous genetic insult attenuated neuronal spiking by increasing the afterhyperpolarization. At the molecular level, using a novel technique called iTRAP that combined in utero electroporation and translating ribosome affinity purification, we identified increased translation of two ion channel genes, Kcnq1 and Scn10a. These ion channel candidates were validated by pharmacological rescue and molecular phenocopy. Remarkably, similar excitability deficits were observed in prefrontal neurons from a Tcf4+/tr mouse model of PTHS. Thus, we identify \{TCF4\} as a regulator of neuronal intrinsic excitability in part by repression of Kcnq1 and Scn10a and suggest that this molecular function may underlie pathophysiology associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Cell Counting Kit-8 staining was used to measure cell viability, laser-scanning confocal imaging was used to detect changes in intracellular free calcium concentration, and western blot assay was used to measure neuronal PI3K-p85 expression. Soluble Aβ25–35 was found to reduce cell viability and induce calcium overload in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical neurons, in a concentration-dependent manner. At certain concentrations, soluble Aβ25–35 also increased neuronal PI3K-p85 expression. These findings reveal that soluble Aβ25–35 reduces the viability of cultured cerebral cortical rat neurons. The neurotoxicity mechanism may involve calcium overload and disruption of insulin signal transduction pathways. "

Although interneurons have some of the highest metabolic demands in the postnatal brain, the importance of mitochondria during interneuron development is unknown. We find that interneuron migration from the basal forebrain to the neocortex is highly sensitive to perturbations in oxidative phosphorylation. Both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of adenine nucleotide transferase 1 (Ant1) disrupts the non-radial migration of interneurons, but not the radial migration of cortical projection neurons. The selective dependence of cortical interneuron migration on oxidative phosphorylation may be a mechanistic pathway upon which multiple developmental and metabolic pathologies converge. "

However, whether opioids, well-known analgesics with euphoric properties, similarly induce dissociable signaling adaptations in these neurons remains unclear. Transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled \{D1\} or \{D2\} neurons were implanted with intravenous jugular catheters. Mice learned to self-administer 0.1 mg/kg/infusion of the opioid remifentanil during 2 h sessions over 13 contiguous days. Thereafter, the electrophysiological properties of D1- and D2-MSNs in the shell region of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were assessed. We found that prior opioid exposure did not alter the basic membrane properties nor the kinetics or amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). However, when challenged with the mu opioid receptor (μOR) agonist DAMGO, the characteristic inhibitory profile of this receptor was altered. \{DAMGO\} inhibited the frequency of mEPSCs in D1-MSNs from control mice receiving saline and in D2-MSNs from mice exposed to remifentanil or saline, but this inhibitory profile was reduced in D1-MSNs from mice receiving remifentanil. Remifentanil exposure also altered the probability of glutamate release onto D1-, but not D2-MSNs. Together these results suggest a D1-pathway specific effect associated with the acquisition of opioid-seeking behaviors. "

It is composed of morphologically and functionally distinct subpopulations of primary projection neurons that form complex circuits across the central nervous system. The precisely-timed generation of projection neurons from neural stem cells governs their differentiation, postmitotic specification, and signaling, and is critical for cognitive and sensorimotor ability. Developmental perturbations to the birthdate, location, and connectivity of neocortical neurons are observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders. These facts are highlighting the importance of the precise spatiotemporal development of the neocortex regulated by intricate transcriptional, but also complex post-transcriptional events. Indeed, mRNA transcripts undergo many post-transcriptional regulatory steps before the production of functional proteins, which specify neocortical neural stem cells and subpopulations of neocortical neurons. Therefore, particular attention is paid to the differential post-transcriptional regulation of key transcripts by RNA-binding proteins, including splicing, localization, stability, and translation. We also present a transcriptome screen of candidate molecules associated with post-transcriptional mRNA processing that are differentially expressed at key developmental time points across neocortical prenatal neurogenesis.

However, the exact mechanism by which \{PRL\} mediates this effect is not completely understood. The aim of our study was to assess whether prolactin exerts neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in an in vitro model using primary cell cultures of hippocampal neurons, and to determine whether this effect is mediated via the prolactin receptor (PRLR). Primary cell cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were used in all experiments, gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR, and protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Cell viability was assessed by using the \{MTT\} method. The results demonstrated that \{PRL\} treatment of neurons from primary cultures did not modify cell viability, but that it exerted a neuroprotective effect, with cells treated with \{PRL\} showing a significant increase of viability after glutamate (Glu) – induced excitotoxicity as compared with neurons treated with Glu alone. Cultured neurons expressed mRNA for both \{PRL\} and its receptor (PRLR), and both \{PRL\} and \{PRLR\} expression levels changed after the excitotoxic insult. Interestingly, the \{PRLR\} protein was detected as two main isoforms of 100 and 40 kDa as compared with that expressed in hypothalamic cells, which was present only as a 30 kDa variant. On the other hand, \{PRL\} was not detected in neuron cultures, either by western blot or by immunohistochemistry. Neuroprotection induced by \{PRL\} was significantly blocked by specific oligonucleotides against PRLR, thus suggesting that the \{PRL\} role is mediated by its receptor expressed in these neurons. The overall results indicated that \{PRL\} induces neuroprotection in neurons from primary cell cultures. "

In the present study, we investigated the role of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in regulating microglial nitric oxide production and its role in causing neuronal damage. The study revealed that \{TCDD\} stimulates the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as well as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further, a rapid activation of p38 and \{JNK\} \{MAPKs\} was found in \{HAPI\} microglia following \{TCDD\} treatment. Blockage of p38 and \{JNK\} kinases with their specific inhibitors, \{SB202190\} and SP600125, significantly reduced TCDD-induced iNOS expression and \{NO\} production. In addition, it was demonstrated through treating rat primary cortical neurons with media conditioned with \{TCDD\} treated microglia that microglial iNOS activation mediates neuronal apoptosis. Lastly, it was also found that p38 and \{JNK\} \{MAPK\} inhibitors could attenuate the apoptosis of rat cortical neurons upon exposure to medium conditioned by TCDD-treated \{HAPI\} microglial cells. Based on these observations, we highlight that the p38/JNK \{MAPK\} pathways play an important role in TCDD-induced iNOS activation in rat \{HAPI\} microglia and in the subsequent induction of apoptosis in primary cortical neurons.

The objective of this study was to clarify nociceptive phenotype alterations of subchondral bone afferents of the distal femur in mono-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced \{OA\} rats. Methods \{OA\} was induced by intra-articular injection of \{MIA\} in rats. Two different retrograde tracers were separately injected into the knee joint cavity and the subchondral bone to identify joint and subchondral bone afferents. Immunohistochemistry was used at 2 weeks (early stage) and 6 weeks (advanced stage) after \{MIA\} injection to determine the expression of nociceptive markers (calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and tyrosine receptor kinase A (TrkA)) and the soma size distribution of CGRP-immunoreactive (IR) neurons. Histological subchondral bone and cartilage damage was scored according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International grading system. Pain-related behavior was evaluated using weight distribution and mechanical sensitivity of the hind paw. Results \{OA\} caused an up-regulation of CGRP, TrkA and enlargement of soma size of CGRP-IR neurons in both joint and subchondral bone afferents. \{CGRP\} and TrkA expression in subchondral bone afferents gradually increased over 6 weeks. Furthermore, up-regulation of \{CGRP\} and TrkA in subchondral bone afferents displayed a strong correlation with the subchondral bone damage score. Conclusion Up-regulation of nociceptive markers in subchondral bone afferents correlated with subchondral bone damage, suggesting that subchondral bone is a therapeutic target, especially in the case of advanced stage knee OA.

Our ultrastructural study revealed that \{PAPs\} are actually devoid of Ca2+ stores and have a high surface-to-volume ratio favorable for uptake.

Thus, the anatomic data do not support communication involving Ca2+ stores in tripartite synapses, but rather point to extrasynaptic communication. "

Islet-1 is not essential for the initial differentiation of sympathoadrenal cells, as indicated by the correct expression of pan-neuronal and catecholaminergic subtype specific genes in primary sympathetic ganglia of Islet-1 deficient mouse embryos. However, our data indicate that the subsequent survival of sympathetic neuron precursors and their differentiation towards TrkA expressing neurons depends on Islet-1 function. In contrast to spinal sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons of Islet-1 deficient mice did not display ectopic expression of genes normally present in the CNS. In Islet-1 deficient mouse embryos the numbers of chromaffin cells were only mildly reduced, in contrast to that of sympathetic neurons, but the initiation of the adrenaline synthesizing enzyme \{PNMT\} was abrogated and the expression level of chromogranin A was diminished. Microarray analysis revealed that developing chromaffin cells of Islet-1 deficient mice displayed normal expression levels of TH, \{DBH\} and the transcription factors Phox2B, Mash-1, Hand2, Gata3 and Insm1, but the expression levels of the transcription factors Gata2 and Hand1, and AP-2ß were significantly reduced.

We demonstrate that acute activation of AgRP neurons causes insulin resistance through impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into brown adipose tissue (BAT). AgRP neuron activation acutely reprograms gene expression in \{BAT\} toward a myogenic signature, including increased expression of myostatin. Interference with myostatin activity improves insulin sensitivity that was impaired by AgRP neurons activation. Optogenetic circuitry mapping reveals that feeding and insulin sensitivity are controlled by both distinct and overlapping projections. Stimulation of AgRP → \{LHA\} projections impairs insulin sensitivity and promotes feeding while activation of AgRP → anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBNST)vl projections, distinct from AgRP → aBNSTdm projections controlling feeding, mediate the effect of AgRP neuron activation on BAT-myostatin expression and insulin sensitivity. Collectively, our results suggest that AgRP neurons in mice induce not only eating, but also insulin resistance by stimulating expression of muscle-related genes in BAT, revealing a mechanism by which these neurons rapidly coordinate hunger states with glucose homeostasis.

abstract = "Abstract Production and death of deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) neurons were investigated in the weaver condition at appropriate anatomical levels throughout the mediolateral (medial, intermediate and lateral) and rostrocaudal (rostral, middle and caudal) axes of three DCN-cell groups: the fastigial, the interposed and the dentate nuclei. Current results have denoted that the deficit of \{DCN\} neurons is always more important in the homozygous weaver than in the heterozygous weaver mice. No loss of neurons was found in the dentate nucleus. In the mediolateral axis, an intranuclear gradient of depletion was observed in the mutant mice; in a given deep nucleus, neurodegeneration was more prominent in the medial pars than in lateral ones. In the rostrocaudal axis, on the other hand, when each deep nucleus was studied and compared as a whole, neuron loss was higher in the fastigial nucleus than in the interposed nucleus, which, in turn, was more important than in the dentate nucleus. These data suggest that, in the weaver condition, an internuclear gradient of neurodegeneration exists. Moreover, neurons located in rostral parts of a given nucleus appear to be more vulnerable than those settled in middle parts and these, in turn, are more than the caudal ones. These results seem to indicate the presence of an intranuclear gradient of depletion. Current autoradiographic results have revealed that, in the rostrocaudal axis, deep neurons are settled in the weaver cerebellum following three neurogenetic gradients. The first of these is internuclear; if each deep nucleus is analyzed and compared as a whole, the fastigial nucleus has more late-generated neurons than the interposed nucleus, and this, in turn, has more than the dentate nucleus. The second gradient is also internuclear; if the proportion of late-born neurons is compared throughout the rostral levels from each deep nucleus, it is observed that proportions increase from the fastigial to the dentate nucleus. A similar picture emerges when the middle and caudal regions are taken into account. The third gradient is intranuclear; in a given deep nucleus, the rostral region always presents more late-produced neurons than the middle region and these, in turn, more than in the caudal level. "

The results revealed that within the concentrations of 2.5–10 μg L−1, avermectin showed obvious cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner to neurons of King pigeon in vitro. Cell viability were 99.93 ± 8.52%, 82.02 ± 4.99% and 78.23 ± 5.67% after 24 h of treatment with avermectin at the concentrations of 0, 2.5 and 5 μg L−1, which decreased to 56.36 ± 2.17% of 10 μg L−1. Treated cells showed typical apoptosis morphological changes including cytoplasmic vacuolation, chromatin condensation, unclear nuclear membrane and decreased/swollen mitochondria. Typical biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis including Δψm loss, \{PS\} exposure, activations of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9, \{DNA\} fragmentation were observed too. Moreover, the levels of \{ROS\} in the avermectin treatment groups increased significantly compared to control group. Furthermore, the caspase-3 mRNA levels increased significantly following \{AVM\} treatment. In conclusion, our experimental results show that avermectin has cytotoxicity to brain neurons of King pigeon in vitro and the mechanism of neurotoxicity induced by avermectin is closely related to apoptosis.

However, the distinct roles of different chemokines in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain and in their interactions with neurons have not been clearly elucidated. We found that spinal nerve ligation (SNL) not only induced persistent neuropathic pain symptoms, including mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia, but also produced sustained \{CXCL1\} upregulation in the spinal cord. Double staining of immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization revealed that \{CXCL1\} was primarily induced in spinal astrocytes. In cultured astrocytes, tumor necrosis factor-α induced robust \{CXCL1\} expression via the activation of the c-jun N-terminal kinase. Intrathecal administration of \{CXCL1\} neutralizing antibody transiently reduced SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity, suggesting an essential role of \{CXCL1\} in neuropathic pain sensitization. In particular, intraspinal delivery of \{CXCL1\} shRNA lentiviral vectors, either before or after SNL, persistently attenuated SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity. Spinal application of \{CXCL1\} not only elicited pain hypersensitivity but also induced rapid neuronal activation, as indicated by the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cAMP response element binding protein, and c-Fos in spinal cord neurons. Interestingly, CXCR2, the primary receptor of CXCL1, was upregulated in dorsal horn neurons after SNL, and the \{CXCR2\} antagonist \{SB225002\} completely blocked the CXCL1-induced heat hyperalgesia. \{SB225002\} also attenuated SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity. Collectively, our results have demonstrated a novel form of chemokine-mediated glial-neuronal interaction in the spinal cord that can drive neuropathic pain. Inhibition of the CXCL1-CXCR2 signaling may offer a new therapy for neuropathic pain management. "

Using Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp techniques, we found different types of Ca2+ entry in cultured rat cortical neurons. The presence of Ca2+ in the extracellular solution was required to generate the [Ca2+]i responses to 30 μM N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or KA. The dynamics of NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i responses were fast, while KA-induced responses developed slower reaching high [Ca2+]i. Ifenprodil, a specific inhibitor of the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, reduced NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i responses suggesting expression of GluN1/GluN2B receptors. Using IEM-1460, a selective blocker of Ca2+-permeable GluA2-subunit lacking AMPARs, we found three neuronal responses to KA: (i) IEM-1460 resistant neurons which are similar to pyramidal neurons expressing Ca2+-impermeable GluA2-rich AMPARs; (ii) Neurons exhibiting nearly complete block of both KA-induced currents and [Ca2+]i signals by IEM-1460 may represent interneurons expressing GluA2-lacking \{AMPARs\} and (iii) neurons with moderate sensitivity to IEM-1460. Ouabain at 1 nM prevented the neuronal Ca2+ overload induced by KA. The data suggest, that cultured rat cortical neurons maintain functional phenotypes of the adult brain cortex, and demonstrate the key contribution of the Na/K-ATPase in neuroprotection against \{KA\} excitotoxicity.

Firstly, it will be explored whether mirror neurons are the neural basis of our empathic capacities: a vast array of empirical results appears to confirm this hypothesis. Secondly, the higher level capacity of reenactive empathy will be examined and the question will be addressed whether philosophical analysis alone is able to provide a foundation for this more abstract level of empathy.

Highlights from studies analyzing cytokine-induced changes in early gene expression in mixed \{CNS\} glial cultures focus on comparison of potential damaging effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines versus protective effects of downregulatory cytokines. The three categories of changes examined include (a) immune-related molecules, (b) neurotrophins, growth factors and structural proteins, and (c) molecules associated with metabolism, signaling and regulation. Subsequent studies in \{CNS\} neuronal cultures showed that early responses of neurons to cytokines were fewer in number and lower in magnitude than in glia, consistent with the idea that microglia and astroglia serve as “first responders” to inflammatory signals. To explore the hypothesis that B cells of patients with multiple sclerosis secrete soluble products damaging to oligodendroglia (OL), in collaboration with Dr. Bar-Or at Montreal Neurologic Institute, we compared secretory products of cultured B cells from relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and healthy controls. In support of the hypothesis, 7 supernatants from \{RRMS\} B cells induced death of rat \{OL\} in vitro, while 3 of 4 control samples did not. "

By using the “sliding window” technique, the non-parameter estimate of the ( h , ϕ ) -entropy is formulated. Then, the improved neuron based controllers are developed for multivariate nonlinear non-Gaussian systems by minimizing the entropies of the tracking errors in closed loops. The condition to guarantee the strictly decreasing entropy of tracking error is presented. Moreover, the convergence in the mean-square sense has been analyzed for all the weights in the neural controllers. Finally, the comparative simulation results are presented to show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of \{PID\} control strategy. "

We show that depletion of Ezh2 leads to increased expression of PSD-95, a critical plasticity gene, and that reduced PSD-95 gene transcription is correlated with enrichment of Ezh2 at the PSD-95 gene promoter; however, the \{H3K27me3\} epigenetic mark is not present at the PSD-95 gene promoter, likely due to the antagonizing effects of the \{H3S28P\} and \{H3K27Ac\} marks and the activity of the \{H3K27\} demethylases \{JMJD3\} and UTX. In contrast, increased PSD-95 gene transcription is accompanied by the presence of Ezh1 and elongation-engaged \{RNA\} Polymerase \{II\} complexes at the PSD-95 gene promoter, while knock-down of Ezh1 reduces PSD-95 transcription.

DCBN, but not MMZ, induced inflammation-like pathological changes in OE, and \{DCBN\} increased interleukin IL-6 levels in nasal-wash fluid to much greater magnitude and duration than did MMZ. At 24 h after \{DCBN\} injection, the population of horizontal basal cells (HBCs; reserve, normally quiescent \{OE\} stem cells) lining the \{DMM\} became severely depleted as some of them detached from the basal lamina, and sloughed into the nasal cavity along with the globose basal cells (GBCs; heterogeneous population of stem and progenitor cells), neurons, and sustentacular cells of the neuroepithelium. In contrast, the layer of \{HBCs\} remained intact in MMZ-treated mice, as only the mature elements of the neuroepithelium were shed. Despite the respiratory metaplasia accompanying the greater severity of the \{DCBN\} lesion, residual \{HBCs\} that survived intoxication were activated by the injury and contributed to the metaplastic respiratory epithelium, as shown by tracing their descendants in a K5CreErT2::fl(stop)TdTomato strain of mice in which recombination causes \{HBCs\} to express TdTomato in advance of the lesion. But, contrary to published observations with MMZ, the \{HBCs\} failed to form ORNs. A role for IL-6 in suppressing \{ORN\} regeneration in DCBN-treated mice was rejected by the failure of the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone to prevent the subsequent respiratory metaplasia in the DMM, suggesting that other factors lead to \{HBC\} neuro-incompetence.

Overall, seven different types of olfactory sensilla containing specialized \{ORNs\} were identified in each sex of S. lepidus. Among them, three different types of sensilla in the males and two types in the females housed \{ORNs\} specialized for pheromone-related compounds. The \{ORNs\} in males were specialized for 4-methyl-3,5-heptanedione or one or more of four stereoisomers of 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-3-heptanone. In contrast, female sensilla did not contain \{ORNs\} sensitive to 4-methyl-3,5-heptanedione while they contained \{ORNs\} sensitive to and specialized for the stereoisomers of (4S,5S)-5-hydroxy-4-methyl-3-heptanone. In addition to the pheromone-related ORNs, four types of olfactory sensilla contained \{ORNs\} responsive to plant volatile compounds in male S. lepidus, and five types in females. Most of the \{ORNs\} identified in S. lepidus showed a high degree of specificity to specific volatile compounds although some of the active compounds showed overlapping response spectra in the \{ORNs\} across different types of sensilla. The most active plant volatile compounds were the four green leaf volatile compounds, (E)-2-hexenol, (Z)-2-hexenol, (Z)-3-hexenol and (E)-2-hexenal, and isomers of two monoterpenols, (±)-linalool and (±)-α-terpineol, all eliciting strong responses from relatively large numbers of \{ORNs\} in male and female S. lepidus. Our study indicates that S. lepidus has a set of highly sensitive and selective \{ORNs\} for pheromone and plant volatile compounds. Further work is needed to elucidate the behavioral implications of these findings. "

abstract = "Abstract Importance: Allgrove syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, autonomic dysfunction and amyotrophy. The syndrome has been described in childhood and adult presentation, as in our case, is very rare. There is a considerable delay in diagnosis due to lack of awareness about the syndrome. Observations: We report a single case of a 36 year old man who was initially diagnosed and treated for achalasia cardia in our institute 14 years before. After 8 years he presented again with weakness and wasting predominantly distally. He had tongue fasciculations, brisk reflexes and extensor plantar. After supportive electrophysiological studies he was diagnosed as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. After 5 years he presented with generalised fatigue without any significant worsening of his neurological status. On reevaluation he had alacrimia, autonomic dysfunction and mild \{ACTH\} resistance. Conclusions and relevance: Allgrove syndrome may be an underdiagnosed cause of multisystem neurological disease due to the heterogeneous clinical presentation as well as for ignorance of clinician about the syndrome. Based on our case, we also believe that there does exist a subgroup of patients who follow a less severe and chronic course. Recognition of syndrome allows for treatment of autonomic dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency and dysphagia. "

abstract = "Summary Somatic mutation in neurons is linked to neurologic disease and implicated in cell-type diversification. However, the origin, extent, and patterns of genomic mutation in neurons remain unknown. We established a nuclear transfer method to clonally amplify the genomes of neurons from adult mice for whole-genome sequencing. Comprehensive mutation detection and independent validation revealed that individual neurons harbor ∼100 unique mutations from all classes but lack recurrent rearrangements. Most neurons contain at least one gene-disrupting mutation and rare (0–2) mobile element insertions. The frequency and gene bias of neuronal mutations differ from other lineages, potentially due to novel mechanisms governing postmitotic mutation. Fertile mice were cloned from several neurons, establishing the compatibility of mutated adult neuronal genomes with reprogramming to pluripotency and development. "

Methods We investigated two different models, middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion and MOG35–55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In stroke experiments we measured infarct sizes by magnetic resonance imaging and vital stainings and correlated them with plasma levels of neuron specific enolase (NSE) at different time points after reperfusion. Equally, in \{EAE\} experiments, we correlated \{NSE\} levels with neurological scores and histopathological damage of axons at different time points. We detected plasma \{NSE\} levels by ELISA. Results Plasma \{NSE\} levels correlated significantly with stroke size, \{EAE\} score and histopathological damage in EAE. Investigations into the dynamics of neuronal loss over time correlated well with the dynamics of \{NSE\} levels. \{NSE\} even predicted the onset of EAE, before clinical signs were recordable. Conclusions Plasma \{NSE\} is a valid and simple experimental biomarker that allows quantifying the degree of neuronal injury in a non-invasive approach. "

Thus, we performed an exhaustive ultrastructural study of mitochondria in motor neurons from aged rats that revealed dramatic alterations in the mitochondria of axon terminals at neuromuscular junctions, characterized by swelling, mitochondrial fusion and the presence of megamitochondria. These alterations were not observed in ventral horn motor neurons in the spinal cord of aged rats, which were only altered by the appearance of electron-dense bodies in the dilated matrix cristae. Using X-ray microanalytical techniques we demonstrated the presence of calcium in these bodies, suggesting Ca2 + overload. Moreover, in motor neurons from aged rats, cytochrome c and activated caspase 3 were detected in the cytoplasm of axon terminals at neuromuscular junctions, factors implicated in the apoptosis. Active caspase 3 was also found in the nucleus, soma and axons of aged alpha motor neuron neurons, where it mainly associated with microtubules. The colocalization of dynein and cleaved caspase 3 in neuromuscular junctions is strongly suggestive of the retrograde transport of apoptotic factors to the soma. These results are consistent with the early stages of degeneration in neuromuscular junctions during aging, which is followed by dying back. Given that aging is a key risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the identification of age-related motor neuron degeneration initiated at the distal end of the axon may provide a new therapeutic target for early intervention.

However, challenges, such as unknown nonlinearities in the spike–calcium relationship, noise, and the often relatively low temporal resolution of the calcium signal compared to the time-scale of spike generation, restrict the accurate estimation of action potentials from the calcium signal. Complex neuronal discharge, such as the activity demonstrated by bursting and rhythmically active neurons, represents an even greater challenge for reconstructing spike trains based on calcium signals. We propose a method using blind calcium signal deconvolution based on an information-theoretic approach. This model is meant to maximise the output entropy of a nonlinear filter where the nonlinearity is defined by the cumulative distribution function of the spike signal. We tested our maximum entropy (ME) algorithm using bursting olfactory receptor neurons (bORNs) of the lobster olfactory organ. The advantage of the \{ME\} algorithm is that the filter can be trained online based only on the statistics of the spike signal, without any assumptions regarding the unknown transfer function characterizing the relation between the spike and calcium signal. We show that the \{ME\} method is able to more accurately reconstruct the timing of the first and last spikes of a burst compared to other methods and that it improves the temporal precision fivefold compared to direct timing resolution of calcium signal.

One important issue in neurobiology is to understand the molecular factors that determine the neuron to develop polarized structures. A particularly early event, in neurons still lacking a discernible axon, is the segregation of IGF-1 (Insulin like Growth Factor-1) receptors in one neurite. This receptor can be activated by insulin in bulk, but, it is not known if changes of insulin organization as a monomolecular film may affect neuron polarization. To this end, in this work we developed solid-supported Langmuir–Blodgett films of insulin with different surface packing density. Hyppocampal pyramidal neurons, in early stage of differentiation, were cultured onto those substrates and polarization was studied after 24 h by confocal microscopy. Also we used surface reflection interference contrast microscopy and confocal microscopy to study attachment patterns and morphology of growth cones. We observed that insulin films packed at 14 mN/m induced polarization in a similar manner to high insulin concentration in bulk, but insulin packed at 44 mN/m did not induce polarization. Our results provide novel evidence that the neuron polarization through IGF-1 receptor activation can be selectively modulated by the lateral packing of insulin organized as a monomolecular surface for cell growth.

A scalable system architecture is described, including \{IF\} neurons with a nonlinear firing function, and current-based synapses to provide linear computation. A network of 18 neurons with 12 inputs is implemented on the RASP 2.9v chip, a Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) with directly programmable floating gate elements. Said system uses over 1400 floating gates, the largest system programmed on a \{FPAA\} to date. The circuit successfully reproduced the outputs of a digital optimization program, converging to within 4.8% RMS, and an objective cost only 1.7% higher on average. The active circuit consumed 559 μA of current at 2.4 V and converges on solutions in 25 μs, with measurement of the converged spike rate taking an additional 1 ms. Extrapolating the scaling trends to a N = 1000 node system, the spiking \{LCA\} compares favorably with state-of-the-art digital solutions, and analog solutions using a non-spiking approach. "

Results and conclusions Here we generated a novel ERα-ZsGreen reporter mouse line in which expression of a green fluorescent reporter protein, ZsGreen, is driven by a 241 kb ERα gene promoter. We validated that ZsGreen is highly colocalized with endogenous ERα in the brain. Native ZsGreen signals were visualized in unfixed brain tissue, and were used to assist single cell collection and electrophysiological recordings. Finally, we demonstrated that this ERα-ZsGreen mouse allele can be used in combination with other genetic reporter alleles to allow experiments in highly selective neural populations. "

The attraction domain of spiking and bursting for three different parameter values are calculated. Synchronization transition processes of two coupled Leech neurons, one is bursting and the other the co-existing spiking, are simulated for the three parameters. The three synchronization processes appear similar as the coupling strength increases, beginning from non-synchronization to complete synchronization through a complex dynamical procedure, but their detailed processes are different depending on the parameter values. The transition procedure is complex and the complete synchronization is in bursting for larger parameter values, while the process is simple with complete synchronization of spiking for smaller values. The potential relationship between complete synchronization and the attraction domain is also discussed. The results are instructive to understanding the synchronization behaviors of the coupled neuronal system with co-existing attractors. "

Orexin A/hypocretin-1 (OXA) and orexin B/hypocretin-2 (OXB) bind to two metabotropic receptors, named the \{OX1\} and \{OX2\} receptors. The lateral geniculate complex of the thalamus is one of the many targets of orexinergic fibres derived from the lateral hypothalamus, although the impact of orexins on the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (VLG) is poorly understood. The VLG, an important relay station of the subcortical visual system, is implicated in visuomotor and/or circadian processes. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the effects of orexins on single \{VLG\} neurons using a patch-clamp technique in vitro. Surprisingly, orexins depolarised the majority of the recorded neurons regardless of their localisation in the borders of the VLG. In addition, data presented in this article show that neurons synthesising \{NO\} were also affected by OXA. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of \{OXB\} revealed the moderate density of orexinergic fibbers in the VLG. Our study using specific orexin receptor antagonists suggests that the \{OX2\} receptor has a dominant role in the observed effects of OXA. To our knowledge, this article is the first to show orexinergic modulation of the VLG. These findings strengthen the postulated link between orexins and the circadian system, and propose a new role of these neuropeptides in the modulation of visuomotor functions. "

To reveal developmental formation of the \{CGRP\} network and its function in neuronal maturation, we examined the immunohistochemical localization of \{CGRP\} in the developing mouse cervical spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion. \{CGRP\} immunolabeling (IL) was first detected in motor neurons on E13, and in ascending axons of the posterior funiculus and \{DRG\} neurons on E14. CGRP-positive sensory axon fibers entered Laminae I and \{II\} on E16, and Laminae I through \{IV\} on E18. The intensity of the CGRP-IL gradually increased in both ventral and dorsal horns during embryonic development, but markedly decreased in the ventral horn after birth. These results suggest that \{CGRP\} is expressed several days after neuronal settling and entry of sensory fibers, and that the \{CGRP\} network is formed in chronological and sequential order. Furthermore, because \{CGRP\} is markedly expressed in motor neurons when axons are vastly extending and innervating targets, \{CGRP\} may also be involved in axonal elongation and synapse formation during normal development.

This characteristic has caused mu suppression to be used as proxy marker for mirror neuron activation. However, there is little direct evidence that fluctuations in mu rhythm suppression reflect concurrent fluctuations in mirror neuron activity. A manual imitation paradigm was used to look at correlations between mu rhythm and \{BOLD\} response, by recording sequential \{EEG\} and fMRI measures to allow within-subject correlation analyses. Participants were instructed to imitate or observe actions involving the movement of a handle with their right hand. Mu power modulation, defined as mu power changes between conditions, correlated negatively with \{BOLD\} response in right inferior parietal lobe, premotor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus; putative mirror neuron areas. Clusters were also identified in bilateral cerebellum, left medial frontal gyrus, right temporal lobe and thalamus. This suggests that mu suppression involves a range of structures that modulate motor preparation activities and are sensitive to visual input, including but not restricted to the human analogue of the mirror neuron system.

Soft computing techniques have been widely studied and successfully applied to engine system reliability prediction with the ability to deal with high non-linearity. However, the development of conventional soft computing techniques involves many difficulties such as the selection of inputs to the network, the selection of network structure and the calculation of model parameters. The single multiplicative neuron (SMN) model is found to be a viable alternative due to its advantages of better approximation capabilities, simpler network structures and faster learning algorithms. Furthermore, nonlinear filters can deal with additive noises and can update model parameters when a new observation data arrives due to their iterative algorithm structure. In this study, novel techniques based on the \{SMN\} model with iterated nonlinear filtering online training algorithms for engine systems reliability prediction are proposed. Illustrative examples taken from the previous literature are used to demonstrate the detailed implementation procedures and the corresponding results are compared with the existing developed models. The experimental results reveal that the proposed models result in better prediction results than the existing methods. "

To study \{VGLUT3\} we traced the bladder of transgenic mice, in which \{VGLUT3\} is identified by enhanced green fluorescent protein detection. Results Most bladder dorsal root ganglion neurons expressed VGLUT2. A smaller percentage of neurons also expressed \{VGLUT1\} or VGLUT3. Co-expression with calcitonin gene-related peptide was only observed for VGLUT2. Occasional \{VGLUT2\} immunoreactive neurons were seen in the major pelvic ganglia.

abstract = "Abstract Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, is well known for its antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive effects. Modulation of synaptic transmission is one of the analgesic mechanisms of minocycline. Although it has been reported that minocycline may suppress excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission, it remains unclear whether it could affect inhibitory synaptic transmission, which also plays a key role in modulating pain signaling. To examine the effect of minocycline on synaptic transmission in rat spinal substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons, we recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) using whole-cell patch-clamp recording at a holding potential of 0 mV. Bath application of minocycline significantly increased the frequency but not the amplitude of sIPSCs in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner with an \{EC50\} of 85. The enhancement of inhibitory synaptic transmission produced by minocycline was not affected by the glutamate receptor antagonists \{CNQX\} and D-APV or by the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX). Moreover, the potency of minocycline for facilitating sIPSC frequency was the same in both glycinergic and \{GABAergic\} sIPSCs without changing their decay phases. However, the facilitatory effect of minocycline on sIPSCs was eliminated in a Ca2+-free Krebs solution or by co-administration with calcium channel blockers. In summary, our data demonstrate that baseline inhibitory synaptic transmission in \{SG\} neurons is markedly enhanced by minocycline. This may function to decrease the excitability of \{SG\} neurons, thus leading to a modulation of nociceptive transmission. "

abstract = "Summary The role of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in sleep induction and maintenance is well accepted since most insomnia treatments target \{GABAa\} receptors. However, the population(s) of \{GABAergic\} neurons involved in the beneficial effect of \{GABA\} on sleep remains to be identified. This is not an easy task since \{GABAergic\} neurons are widely distributed in all brain structures. A recently growing number of populations of \{GABAergic\} neurons have been involved in sleep control. We first review here possible candidates for inducing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep including the \{GABAergic\} neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic area, the parafacial zone in the brainstem, the nucleus accumbens and the cortex. We also discuss the role of several populations of \{GABAergic\} neurons in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep control. Indeed, it is well accepted that muscle atonia occurring during \{REM\} sleep is due to a GABA/glycinergic hyperpolarization of motoneurons. Recent evidence strongly suggests that these neurons are located in the ventral medullary reticular formation. It has also recently been shown that neurons containing the neuropeptide melanin concentrating hormone and \{GABA\} located in the lateral hypothalamic area control \{REM\} sleep expression. Finally, a population of REM-off \{GABAergic\} neurons located in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray has been shown to gate \{REM\} sleep by inhibiting glutamatergic neurons located in the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus. In summary, recent data clearly indicate that multiple populations of \{GABAergic\} neurons located throughout the brain from the cortex to the medulla oblongata control \{NREM\} and \{REM\} sleep. "

The activity of eEF-2 is regulated by changes in cellular energy status and nutrient availability and by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and mono-ADP-ribosylation. However, the mechanisms regulating protein translation under conditions of cellular stress in neurons are unknown. Here we show that when rat hippocampal neurons experience oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation induced by exposure to cumene hydroperoxide; CH), eEF-2 is hyperphosphorylated and ribosylated, resulting in reduced translational activity. The degradation of eEF-2 requires calpain proteolytic activity and is accompanied by accumulation of eEF-2 in the nuclear compartment. The subcellular localization of both native and phosphorylated forms of eEF-2 is influenced by \{CRM1\} and 14.3.3, respectively. In hippocampal neurons p53 interacts with nonphosphorylated (active) eEF-2, but not with its phosphorylated form. The p53–eEF-2 complexes are present in cytoplasm and nucleus, and their abundance increases when neurons experience oxidative stress. The nuclear localization of active eEF-2 depends upon its interaction with p53, as cells lacking p53 contain less active eEF-2 in the nuclear compartment. Overexpression of eEF-2 in hippocampal neurons results in increased nuclear levels of eEF-2 and decreased cell death after exposure to CH. Our results reveal novel molecular mechanisms controlling the differential subcellular localization and activity state of eEF-2 that may influence the survival status of neurons during periods of elevated oxidative stress.

This pathology is caused by an altered \{BCAA\} metabolism with the accumulation of toxic keto acids in tissues and body fluids with consequent severe neurological symptoms. In animal models of \{BCAA\} accumulation, increased oxidative stress levels and lipid peroxidation have been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze both whether high \{BCAA\} concentrations in neurons induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and whether, by performing electrophysiological recordings, the neuronal functional properties are modified. Our results demonstrate that in primary cortical cultures, a high dose of valine increases \{ROS\} production and provokes neuronal hyperexcitability because the action potential frequencies and the persistent sodium current amplitudes increase significantly compared to non-treated neurons. Since Baicalein, a flavone obtained from the Scutellaria root, has been shown to act as a strong antioxidant with neuroprotective effects, we evaluated its possible antioxidant activity in primary cortical neurons chronically exposed to L-valine. The preincubation of cortical neurons with Baicalein prevents the \{ROS\} production and is able to revert both the neuronal hyperexcitability and the increase of the persistent sodium current, indicating a direct correlation between the \{ROS\} production and the altered physiological parameters. In conclusion, our data show that the electrophysiological alterations of cortical neurons elicited by high valine concentration are due to the increase in \{ROS\} production, suggesting much caution in the intake of \{BCAA\} dietary integrators.

Although some important mechanisms that might contribute to the death of motor neurons have been identified, the mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology are still uncertain. In particular, the mechanisms underlying the role of gender in \{ALS\} and whether treatments should take into account sexual dimorphism remain only partially understood. Recently, the \{P2X7\} receptor for \{ATP\} was reported to display neurotoxic potential in motor neuron disorders, and antagonism of the receptor has been suggested to be helpful in these disorders. Studying transgenic mice with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations, widely used as model for ALS, may provide a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and of toxicity towards motor neurons, also possibly helping to understand whether treatments for \{ALS\} should take into account sexual dimorphism. The aim of the work was (1) investigating on gender-dependence of disease progression in the standard model for \{ALS\} – the transgenic mouse bearing superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations – and (2) assessing if a \{P2X7\} receptor antagonist treatment should take into account sexual dimorphism. We evaluated if gender affect the disease course, the motor performance, the weight loss and the lifespan in mice overexpressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1. We measured motor impairment, motor strength and coordination by rotarod and grip strength testing. Further, we assessed if a treatment with the \{P2X7\} receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue G – a dye that can cross the blood–brain barrier, has low toxicity, and has exhibited therapeutic effects in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases – impact on the disease progression, in male and female \{ALS\} mice. We found that (1) the onset and the disease progression, and the survival were dependent on gender: male performed worst than female, lost body weight and died before; (2) treatment with the \{P2X7\} receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue G ameliorated the disease progression. The treatment effect was gender-dependent: amelioration was greater in male than in female. In conclusions, we suggest that not only pathogenetic mechanism of motor neuron toxicity but also the drug treatment effectiveness may depend on gender; sexual dimorphism should be considered when investigating on \{ALS\} treatment efficacy in the \{ALS\} animal model. Our findings also point on the potential relevance of \{P2X7\} receptor antagonism for \{ALS\} treatment, and highlight the importance of adopting a sex-specific approach to searching for treatment of ALS.

Cells in the experimental group (EG) were treated with \{ECM\} and multi-cell factors in a multi-step induction process, while the control group (CG) was treated similarly, except without ECM. In the EG, after induction, the cells formed processes that connected with neighboring cells to form a net that had directionality. In these cells, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and synaptophysin (SYN) expression levels increased and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression decreased. The \{SYN\} expression in the \{EG\} cells was higher compared with those in the CG. In the CG, \{NSE\} expression increased, while the expression of Nestin and \{SYN\} did not change. These were several changes in the levels of other genes: \{ADMSCs\} at passage 1 expressed Nanog, SOX2, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) and Nestin. In the EG, at the beginning of induction, the expression of Nanog decreased and that of \{SOX2\} and Nestin increased. After 2 days, the cells expressed Nestin, \{OCT4\} and SYNIII, and after 3 days, they expressed Olig2, OCT4, Nestin, \{SYNII\} and Islet1 (ISL1). Finally, at day 6, the cells expressed Nestin, SYNI, SYNIII, ISL-1, homeobox 9 (Hb9) and oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (Olig2). In the CG, the cells never expressed SYNI, \{SYNII\} or Hb9. Our studies therefore demonstrate that the extracted \{ECM\} was capable of promoting the maturation of synapses. Human \{ADMSCs\} are composed of multiple cell subsets, including neural progenitor cells. The multi-step induction method used in this study causes human \{ADMSCs\} to differentiate into \{MN\} precursor cells. "

For example, \{GABAA\} receptor (GABAAR)-mediated synaptic currents, (miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents; mIPSCs), which initially exhibit a relatively slow decay phase, become progressively reduced in duration, thereby supporting the temporal resolution required for mature network activity. Here we report that during postnatal development of cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, GABAAR-mediated phasic inhibition is influenced by a resident neurosteroid tone, which wanes in the second postnatal week, resulting in the brief phasic events characteristic of mature neuronal signalling. Treatment of cortical slices with the immediate precursor of 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (5α3α), the GABAAR-inactive 5α-dihydroprogesterone, (5α-DHP), greatly prolonged the mIPSCs of \{P20\} pyramidal neurons, demonstrating these more mature neurons retain the capacity to synthesize GABAAR-active neurosteroids, but now lack the endogenous steroid substrate. Previously, such developmental plasticity of phasic inhibition was ascribed to the expression of synaptic \{GABAARs\} incorporating the α1 subunit. However, the duration of mIPSCs recorded from L2/3 cortical neurons derived from α1 subunit deleted mice, were similarly under the developmental influence of a neurosteroid tone. In addition to principal cells, synaptic \{GABAARs\} of L2/3 interneurons were modulated by native neurosteroids in a development-dependent manner. In summary, local neurosteroids influence synaptic transmission during a crucial period of cortical neurodevelopment, findings which may be of importance for establishing normal network connectivity.

Neurokinin-3 receptors (NK3Rs) of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides modulate the activity of \{VTA\} \{DA\} neurons and might be involved in \{DA\} abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia. Recent work from our lab showed that systemic injection of the dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonist apomorphine in rats, which mimics schizophrenia-like behaviors in humans, also evoked a redistribution of \{NK3Rs\} in \{DA\} neurons of the rat VTA. In the present study, \{VTA\} microinjection of the selective \{NK3R\} antagonist \{SB222200\} (1 nmol/0.2 μl) or the nuclear import blocker \{SN50\} (2 μg/0.2 μl) was performed in awake rats 10 min prior to systemic injection of apomorphine. \{VTA\} sections were dual immunolabeled for the \{NK3R\} (immunogold) and the dopamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, immunoperoxidase). Electron microscopic quantifications of somatic and dendritic densities of \{NK3\} immunogold particles were compared in rats receiving central and systemic injections. In \{DA\} (TH-labeled) dendrites, \{VTA\} microinjection of \{SB222200\} prevented the apomorphine-evoked decrease in surface \{NK3R\} density as well as the apomorphine-induced increase in cytoplasmic \{NK3R\} density. In contrast, \{VTA\} microinjection of SN50, but not SB222200, prevented the apomorphine-induced increase in nuclear \{NK3R\} density. \{VTA\} microinjection of \{SB222200\} or \{SN50\} without apomorphine had no effect on the \{NK3R\} distribution or density in \{TH\} and non-TH profiles within the VTA. In non-TH, presumably \{GABAergic\} neurons of the VTA, the \{NK3R\} densities in somata and dendrites were not significantly changed by apomorphine with or without SB222200. The results suggest that the \{NK3R\} antagonist \{SB222200\} is effective against the apomorphine-evoked \{NK3R\} internalization in \{VTA\} \{DA\} dendrites, but does not prevent nuclear \{NK3R\} trafficking in \{VTA\} \{DA\} neurons. These results might have important implications in targeting \{NK3R\} antagonists in basic or clinical studies. "

Different neurotransmitters have been found in medullary areas; nevertheless, their involvement in \{UB\} control is few understood. We focused to investigate if cholinergic activation of neurons in the medulla oblongata changes the urinary bladder activity. Carbachol (cholinergic agonist) or atropine (cholinergic antagonist) was injected into the 4thV in anesthetized female Wistar rats and the intravesical pressure (IP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and renal conductance (RC) were recorded for 30 min. Carbachol injection into the 4thV increased \{IP\} with peak response at 30 min after carbachol and yielded no changes in MAP, \{HR\} and RC. Atropine injection into the 4thV decreased \{IP\} and elicited no changes in MAP, \{HR\} and RC. Plasma vasopressin levels evaluated by \{ELISA\} kit assay increased after carbachol into the 4th V. Intravenous blockade of \{V1\} receptors prior to carbachol into the 4thV abolished the increase in \{IP\} evoked by carbachol. Therefore, our findings suggest that cholinergic activation of neurons in the medulla oblongata by carbachol injections into the 4thV increases \{IP\} due to plasma vasopressin release, which acts in \{V1\} receptors in the UB.

In this study, exergy analysis was applied to glucose metabolism of a model neuron, and dynamic exergy destructions were calculated for four different conditions, namely normoxia, hypoxia, glucose starvation and excess glucose. Our results showed that neuronal metabolism achieved a new steady state under each condition within 5 min. This dynamic model predicts that, both exergy destruction and work potential rates increase with increasing blood glucose concentration. The ratio of exergy destruction rate to work potential rate increases logarithmically with increasing blood glucose concentration. The neuronal metabolism is thus found to function in an efficient way and switches to lower exergy destruction under stress conditions such as glucose starvation. This behavior seen in this exergy analysis study confirms the assumption of minimum entropy production in living systems. "

abstract = "Abstract The release of the serine proteinase tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) from the presynaptic terminal of cerebral cortical neurons plays a central role in the development of synaptic plasticity, adaptation to metabolic stress and neuronal survival. Our earlier studies indicate that by inducing the recruitment of the cytoskeletal protein βII-spectrin and voltage-gated calcium channels to the active zone, tPA promotes Ca2+-dependent translocation of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to the synaptic release site where they release their load of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Here we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate whether this effect leads to depletion of \{SVs\} in the presynaptic terminal. Our data indicate that tPA promotes \{SV\} endocytosis via a mechanism that does not require the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin. Instead, we show that tPA induces calcineurin-mediated dynamin I dephosphorylation, which is followed by dynamin I-induced recruitment of the actin-binding protein profilin \{II\} to the presynaptic membrane, and profilin II-induced F-actin formation. We report that this tPA-induced sequence of events leads to the association of newly formed \{SVs\} with F-actin clusters in the endocytic zone. In summary, the data presented here indicate that following the exocytotic release of neurotransmitters tPA activates the mechanism whereby \{SVs\} are retrieved from the presynaptic membrane and endocytosed to replenish the pool of vesicles available for a new cycle of exocytosis. Together, these results indicate that in murine cerebral cortical neurons tPA plays a central role coupling \{SVs\} exocytosis and endocytosis. "

abstract = "As life spans increased, neurodegenerative disorders that affect aging populations have also increased. Progressive neuronal loss in specific brain regions is the most common cause of neurodegenerative disease; however, key determinants mediating neuron loss are not fully understood. Using a model of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) loss, we found only 25% cell loss in SH-SY5Y (SH) neuronal mono-cultures, but interestingly, 85% neuronal loss occurred when neurons were co-cultured with \{BV2\} microglia. \{SH\} neurons overexpressing uncoupling protein 2 exhibited an increase in neuron–microglia interactions, which represent an early step in microglial phagocytosis of neurons. This result indicates that ΔΨm loss in \{SH\} neurons is an important contributor to recruitment of \{BV2\} microglia. Notably, we show that ΔΨm loss in \{BV2\} microglia plays a crucial role in microglial activation and phagocytosis of damaged \{SH\} neurons. Thus, our study demonstrates that ΔΨm loss in both neurons and microglia is a critical determinant of neuron loss. These findings also offer new insights into neuroimmunological and bioenergetical aspects of neurodegenerative disease. "

Accurate methods for quantifying neurons in vitro are lacking; conventional methodologies are limited in reliability and application. The morphological properties of the soma and neurites are a key aspect of neuronal phenotype and function, but the assays commonly used in such evaluations are beset with several methodological drawbacks. Herein we describe automated techniques to quantify the number and morphology of neurons (or any cell type, e.g., astrocytes) and their processes with high speed and accuracy. Neuronal quantification from brain tissue using a motorized stage system yielded results that were statistically comparable to those generated by stereology. The approach was then adapted for in vitro neuron and neurite outgrowth quantification. To determine the utility of our methods, rotenone was used as a neurotoxicant leading to morphological changes in neurons and cell death, astrocytic activation, and loss of neurites. Importantly, our technique counted about 8 times as many neurons in less than 5–10% of the time taken by manual stereological analysis. "

abstract = "Abstract Successful social interaction requires recognising the intention of another person's communicative gestures. At a neural level, this process may involve neural activity in different systems, such as the mentalizing system (MS) and the mirror neuron system (MNS). The aim of the present study was to explore the neural correlates of communicative gestures during observation and execution of these gestures. Twenty participants watched video clips of an actor executing social gestures (S), non-social gestures (NS) and meaningless gestures (ML). During fMRI data acquisition, participants were asked to observe (O) and subsequently to execute (E) one of two tasks: imitate the gesture presented (IMI) or perform a motor control task (CT). For the contrast \{IMI\} &gt; \{CT\} we found activations in the core areas of the \{MNS\} [inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and inferior frontal cortex, the posterior part of pars opercularis], as well as in areas related to the \{MS\} [superior temporal sulcus (STS) and middle cingulate cortex]. For S &gt; NS, we found activations in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), right superior frontal cortex and middle cingulate cortex. The interaction of stimulus condition (S vs NS) and task (IMI vs CT) revealed activation in the right IPL. For the interaction between observation vs execution (O vs E), task (IMI vs CT) and stimulus condition (S vs NS) we found activation in the right mOFC. Our data suggest that imitation is differentially processed in the \{MNS\} as well as in the MS. The activation in \{IPL\} is enhanced during the processing of social gestures most likely due to their communicative intention. The activation of \{IPL\} together with medial frontal areas may contribute to mentalizing processes. The interaction in the mOFC suggests an involvement of self-referential processes in the processing of social gesture. "

Thus, the aim of the present study was to study the influence of prolonged acetylsalicylic acid supplementation on the extrinsic primary sensory neurons supplying the porcine stomach prepyloric region. Fast Blue (FB) was injected into the above-mentioned region of the stomach. Acetylsalicylic acid was then given orally to the experimental gilts from the seventh day after \{FB\} injection to the 27th day of the experiment. After euthanasia, the nodose ganglia (NG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were collected. Sections of these ganglia were processed for routine double-labelling immunofluorescence technique for substance P (SP), calcitonine gene related peptide (CGRP), galanin (GAL), neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Under physiological conditions within the nodose ganglia, the percentage of the FB-labeled neurons immunoreactive to particular substances ranged between 17.9 ± 2.7% (VIP-like immunoreactive (LI) neurons in the right NG) and 60.4 ± 1.7% (SP-LI cells within the left NG). Acetylsalicylic acid supplementation caused a considerable increase in the expression of all active substances studied within both left and right \{NG\} and the percentage of neurons positive to particular substances fluctuated from 47.2 ± 3.6% (GAL-LI neurons in the right NG) to 67.2 ± 2.0% (cells immunoreactive to \{SP\} in the left NG). All studied substances were also observed in \{DRG\} neurons supplying the prepyloric region of the stomach, but the number of immunoreactive neurons was too small to conduct a statistical analysis. The obtained results show that \{ASA\} may influence chemical coding of the sensory neurons supplying the porcine stomach, but the exact mechanisms of this action still remain unknown. "

Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the localization of orexin-immunoreactive neurons in the brain of toads (Rhinella schneideri) and to investigate the contribution of orexin receptor-1 (OX1R) to the hypoxic and hypercarbic ventilatory responses of these animals during light and dark phases. Our results demonstrated that the orexinergic neurons of R. schneideri are located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the diencephalon. Additionally, the intracerebroventricular injection of SB-334867 (OX1R selective antagonist) attenuated the ventilatory response to hypercarbia during the dark phase by acting on tidal volume and breathing frequency, while during the light phase, SB-334867 attenuated the ventilatory response to hypoxia by acting on tidal volume only. We conclude that in the toad R. schneideri, orexinergic neurons are located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and that \{OX1R\} contributes to hypercarbic and hypoxic chemoreflexes. "
